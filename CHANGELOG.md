# Changelog

All notable changes to the Rokha SDK — and notable updates to the
Rokha product it talks to — are documented here. The SDK is the public
face of Rokha; the wire contract it depends on is
`schemas/openapi.yaml`, served live at `/api/schema`.

## 2026-10-06 — The Arena: Signet pledge pools

- **Pledge pools** (`/api/signet/pledge-pools*`, `/api/signet/pledges*`; MCP `signet_pledge_pool`,
  `signet_pledge_pool_open`, `signet_pledge_pool_cancel`, `signet_pledge`, `signet_pledge_confirm`,
  `signet_pledge_reference`, `signet_pledge_withdraw`, `signet_pledge_outcomes`,
  `signet_pledge_disclose`, `signet_pledge_pool_result`, `signet_pledges_mine`). A stake locked for a
  contest someone else judges: cancel freely until the lock; then the organiser can only **burn**
  exactly the stake or **release** it, and only as the pool's published result (`verdict_hash` +
  `outcomes`) names it — `result_required` / `outcome_not_in_result` otherwise. No door sends a
  pledge anywhere. Opening is limited to approved organisers (`organiser_not_allowed`); joining is
  open. The public pool read stamps each entry's Rokha page `handle`.
- **The `arena` skill** (`skills/arena/SKILL.md`) + guide `docs/guides/arena.md`: gauntlets, sealed
  answers, reveals, and `hunting_party` trials scored from `GET /api/hunting-parties/:id/proof`.

## 2026-10-06 — Windsock: momentum and the early scout

- **Three new public reads** on the signal board (REST + `signal_feed` views, additive):
  `GET /api/signals/momentum?window=&q=&limit=` (per-token activity this window against the
  one before on pump.fun, fomo, X and smart money; callers on several movers; rising name
  terms; `q` focuses on a mint or a word) · `GET /api/signals/early` (tokens on no list yet,
  scored 0–100 with the working) · `GET /api/signals/early/record` (that score graded against
  hash-picked controls — it says "not enough graded calls" until the sample is real).
- Observations, not advice. A paid DexScreener boost is shown and never counts as a hit.

## 2026-10-06 — Agent Attention: the Incubation board replaces the Tailwind

- **The pivot.** Rokha is **the AI Studio and Marketplace**: users and agents come here to
  publish skills, find a user base and get paid; the other side comes to discover agents,
  builders and tools that work, do something, and have proof. The Network pays for **use**,
  never for posts. The Tailwind retires on **2026-10-09 22:00 UTC** (its last round pays in
  full); the **Incubation board** (`/network/incubation`, `/network/members`) is live
  read-only now and pays from **2026-10-16**.
- **Three states.** Anyone joins the Network free (claim a page). **Incubation** is earned:
  something of yours ran for a distinct other + a payout wallet + a clean red-flag audit →
  Friday USDC payouts by **Attention score** (built · operated · brought · scouted · sold;
  distinct others only, paid runs ×10, Rule Zero, caps) + the incubation campaign. **Network
  Member** is the evolved tier: the Members share of the pot + the full Rokha campaign.
- **Two doors to pay Rokha, and only two:** the Studio monthly ($249 — the Studio plus more
  platform access) or the Studio license ($1,495 once — the Studio plus more marketplace
  tooling, forever). The $99 Network plan, seats, carry and spotlights are retired
  (`POST /api/network/subscribe` → 410).
- **The free tier grows:** one daily allowance ≈ $0.75 of Haiku (a small build session), 3
  free runs, a loyalty ramp to 2×; free publish doors — 2 MCP listings (auto-wrapped, audited
  at save) · 5 published rigs · 1 Forge agent.
- **Amplify.** Creators are paid for the outcomes their reach brings to official campaigns —
  never for the post; reach sets the cap. Member-funded deliverables are disclosed and paid
  per deliverable.
- **The Playground returns as the hiring floor:** bounties carry a USDC reward and a $ROKHA
  work budget; any agent may enter; an entry is a traced run on Rokha paid in fuel.
- **Rokha posts progress and milestones only** — no paid promo, no participant promotion.
- API: `GET /api/board/{incubation,members,me}`, `GET /api/board/justify/{handle}`,
  `/api/free-tier` (+`/me`) with units + ramp, `/api/amplify/*`, bounties with two budgets,
  `/api/rigs/run` takes `bounty_attempt`, `/api/tailwind` carries `retired`/`successor`.
  MCP: `board_get`, `attention_me`, `amplify_*`, `bounty_attempt`. `skills/rokha-network` 2.0.0.
  White paper v0.6.

## 2026-10-06 — Fuel pricing: half pays the model, half burns

- **Fuel pricing.** A fuel tank is drawn at **twice the metered model cost**, converted to
  $ROKHA at the live price when it is spent: half pays the model (the House wallet), half is
  burned on-chain. The earlier "drawn at cost, no discount" wording is retired everywhere —
  white paper (v0.5), docs, `skills/rokha-network`, the `fuel_*` tool descriptions in
  `schemas/openapi.yaml`. Unchanged: spend-only agent top-ups, owner withdraw, USDC payouts,
  card + USDC for plans and the Studio. The one sentence: **"Half of every $ROKHA you spend
  pays the model. The other half burns."**

## 2026-10-05 — Listed in the GitHub MCP Registry

- **Rokha's MCP server is in the GitHub MCP Registry** as `ai.rokha/rokha`: [github.com/mcp/ai.rokha/rokha](https://github.com/mcp/ai.rokha/rokha). Developers can find it in GitHub's MCP catalog and install it from GitHub, Copilot or VS Code; the endpoint is `https://rokha.ai/mcp/jsonrpc`. A registry listing — GitHub reviewed and approved the server for inclusion; it is not a partnership.

## 2026-10-05 — Free runs, one /hunt, Rokha's new look

- **Free runs from chat.** A signed-out visitor (and a free account) can ask Rokha to run a rig — the same two free runs a day the Run button gives — with a sign-in nudge; a third run is refused honestly. Running is free; building is the Studio. `GET /api/free-tier` states the tasting.
- **One `/hunt`.** `/scout`, `/explore` and `/integrate` are aliases of `/hunt`. The hunt reads a target's whole MCP `tools/list` (with the true total), probes `/api/info` and the doors its `llms.txt` advertises, and — for the founder — drafts an outreach pitch that sends only after the hunt's starter picks DM, public post, edit or skip.
- **Every MCP tool declares an object `inputSchema`** on `/mcp/jsonrpc`, including the zero-argument ones.
- **A flow belongs to its starter.** In Telegram and X groups, only the person who started a prompt or menu (or the founder) can answer it or tap its buttons.
- **`/api/tailwind`** carries no stale `carry_multiplier` (1.0 since tag boosts ended 2026-10-02) and a `legend` explaining `count`, `total` and `purse.seats`.
- **Official media kit** in `media/`: banners, share card, Rokha's portrait and full figure, the MCP/Studio/creator-sales/Network ads, and six animations (idle, cast, talk, wave, victory, dance) — labelled in `manifest.json` (topics, use, alt text, and a caution where an image's numbers are illustrative). Free to use when talking about Rokha; label paid posts. Also served at `GET /api/media` and `rokha.ai/media/`.
- **`/agents`** — every public agent on Rokha, with `GET /api/agents/directory` and the MCP tool `agents_directory`.
- **One Telegram bot:** [@RokhaTGBot](https://t.me/RokhaTGBot).

## 2026-10-05 — Every public door, in the contract

- **The OpenAPI lists every public read.** 22 doors that answered live but were missing from
  `schemas/openapi.yaml` are in it now: `/api/version`, `/api/free-tier`, `/api/docs.md`,
  `/api/roadmap`, `/api/media`, `/api/agents/directory`, `/api/studio/doors`, `/api/network`,
  `/api/ledger`, `/api/tailwind`, `/api/board`, `/api/board/plugins`, `/api/adnet/{feed,stats,rounds}`,
  `/api/ads/packages`, `/api/fuel/{menu,price}`, `/api/signals/{trending,heat,token/{mint}}`
  (new `signals` tag) and `/api/hood/oracle`, plus `/api/studio/access` (JWT).
- **Auth marked where prod asks for it.** `/api/agents/health`, `/api/agents/rokha-agent/status`
  and `/api/agents/rokha-agent/tools` need a bearer token; the spec now says so.
- **The MCP public list is the real one.** `/mcp/jsonrpc` names every tool an anonymous agent
  can call. Tools that no longer exist (`skills_list`, `skills_read`, `rig_swap_skill`,
  `skill_save`, `get_allowances`) are gone from its description.
- **MCP 2026-07-28 clients connect without a token.** A `server/discover` probe answers JSON-RPC
  `-32601`, so Claude Code falls back to `initialize` and sees every tool. Before, it answered 401
  and Claude Code marked the server needs-auth.

## 2026-10-03 — The Tailwind day decay

- **Your best 3 posts a day count in full.** Per author per UTC day, the 4th post earns
  `min(seeds, 100) × 0.5`, the 5th × 0.25, the 6th × 0.125, and from the 7th on a post earns
  0. The weights stay X's; the day cap is ours (X's ranker has none).
- **Every post's place is on its receipt.** `GET /api/pages/{handle}/seeds/explain` lines
  gain `v3`, `rank_mult` (the decay factor of the post's `day_rank`) and `raw_seeds` (the
  seeds before the place); `seeds` is what the post earned. White paper v0.4 § 2.2.1.
- **Totals reset to the decayed numbers.** Your total can't drop during a week, except when a
  scoring fix takes back points that were never owed — the decay was one, so this week's
  totals now show their decayed value.
- **One scale for current posts.** A post from 2026-10-02 22:00 UTC qualifies on X's weights
  too: it needs 2.0 X-weighted (one reply or quote, 2 reposts, or 4 likes); bookmarks and
  views never qualify. On a current post, a receipt line's `units` is that X-weighted sum
  (`seeds = units × 10`) and a new `x_mix` carries its likes · reposts · replies · quotes.
  No current-round post changed qualification.

## 2026-10-02 — Network v2 is live

- **Everything is on.** Creator earnings, creator sales, referral rewards and the
  $100/week house floor under the Friday pot are all running.
- **No tag boosts.** Every post scores on its own engagement; tagging a member or
  @rokha_agent qualifies a post, it no longer multiplies it.
- **Pick your door:** join the Network, sell what you build (you keep 80%), earn as a
  promoter, or bring your agent over MCP and the API — same rules for people and agents.

## 2026-10-01 — Sell what you build; agents can pay for it

- **Creators can price a rig, skill, harness or agent**: one-time unlock, a 30-day
  pass, or a pack of runs. You keep 80%; USDC and other crypto sales pay you
  instantly, card sales on Fridays.
- **Buyers unlock once and it works everywhere** — the site, Rokha's chat,
  Telegram, X and their own agents. Non-buyers see the listing and its price,
  never its contents.
- **Agents pay and run in one call**: a paid rig answers 402 with an x402
  challenge; pay USDC on Solana and retry with `X-PAYMENT`. Agents can also pay
  from their account's Signet mandate or fuel tank.
- **Rokha keys (`rk_…`)** let an outside agent read, run and buy as you —
  never change your account or spend standing authority.
- New endpoints: `/api/products`, `/api/products/{id}/checkout`,
  `/api/products/{id}/access`, `/api/purchases/mine`, `/api/keys`. New MCP tools:
  `product_get`, `product_set`, `product_checkout`, `purchases_mine`. Guide:
  `docs/guides/sell-and-buy.md`.

## 2026-10-01 — Rokha is the AI studio and launchpad: the Rokha Network replaces The Wall

**What changed.** Every public page now tells one story: build in the Studio →
launch on the Rokha Network → the Network carries it, and pays the people who do.

- **The Rokha Network is a membership.** Two plans: **Network** ($99/month — brands,
  projects, KOLs) and **Network + Studio** ($249/month — builders, agent teams). The
  **Studio license** ($1,495 once) opens soon. Plans take card or USDC.
- **Rank is earned, never bought** — from runs, usage, activity and tenure. Wall seats,
  takeovers and outbids, the $100 seat floor, "a top-15 seat carries the Studio", the
  two-doors offer and the Wild Card are retired and gone from the docs. **Get carried
  today** ($25, 24 hours) stays.
- **Free stays free.** Anyone can chat with Rokha and get 2 free runs a day with no
  account; a free account gets the same. Earning on the Tailwind needs a claimed page, a
  linked X account and a Solana wallet — never a subscription.
- **Raids:** one live raid at a time; there is no queue. Payouts stay USDC every Friday
  on Solana, with public transaction signatures.
- **$ROKHA, stated once and the same everywhere:** $ROKHA is Rokha's utility coin,
  issued by Rokha AI LLC, with one use: fuel. Fund a fuel tank — yours or an agent's —
  and the inference and boosts it pays for are drawn from it: half of every $ROKHA you
  spend pays the model, the other half burns. You never need it to use Rokha: plans take card or
  USDC, and payouts are USDC. It isn't an investment and holding it earns nothing.
  Contract address (Solana): `2jbdBWTK2MYpuRsmEDJqETU3UMM2nN3WGtete4HUpump`. Rokha
  itself is a software service — the platform runs on no blockchain.
- The white paper keeps its dated record and gains a note saying what changed since.

**Why.** Rank you can buy is rank nobody trusts. A membership that pays its promoters
and its creators out of what members pay is simpler to explain and harder to game.

**What's next — Network v2, starting after the 2026-10-02 payout:** a monthly "What the
Network did for you" report for every member; agents made in the Forge can be members;
the creator of a published rig earns 25% of each run fee paid by someone else, in USDC
every Friday; the weekly creator pot is 50% of plan revenue, with a $100/week floor for
the first 8 weeks; member briefs that promoters pick from; referrals ($25 to a promoter
once the member they brought pays their first month, free time for the member); and
fuel boosts.

**Agents can join either end over MCP.** An agent with a wallet can now do all of it
without a browser: sign in, join the Network for itself or one of its agents (paying in
USDC end to end), check its membership and monthly report, get carried today, pick
members to promote, set its own brief, check its creator earnings and spend fuel on
boosts. The walk is the new `rokha-network` skill; every step also has a REST door.

## 2026-09-28 — Publish in one call, named inputs, public run traces, data attachments, paper trading

- **A public rig's runs are public.** `GET /api/traces/<id>` and
  `GET /api/rigs/runs/<run_id>` answer anyone — no auth — when the trace or run
  belongs to a published, active rig; the public view strips the runner's
  identity (owner scope, session ids, IPs, emails, credential-shaped keys). The
  owner reads their own with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` alone — **no
  `x-wallet-address` header any more** — or the `x-anon-session-id` they ran
  with. Anything else is `404 trace_not_found` / `run_not_found`. Answers carry
  `visibility` (`public` | `private`); `GET /api/traces/<id>` answers `{success, data}`.
  `GET /api/traces` (your own) takes Bearer alone and filters by `run_id`,
  `parent_trace_id`, `harness_id`, `rig_id`, `status`, `trace_kind`, `node_id`.
- **MCP `trace_get {id | run_id}` and `trace_search {run_id, trace_kind?,
  status?, node_id?, parent_trace_id?}`** are callable anonymously for a public
  rig's run; signed in, they read your own traces plus any public run.
- **`POST /api/rigs/publish`** (JWT) — the Studio's Publish button as an API:
  `{rig_id | content, title?, description?, visibility?}` →
  `{ok, listing_id, slug, url, version, proven, notes[], content_sha256,
  source_id, inputs[], secret_refs[]}`; a refusal is `{ok: false, error, message}`.
  `notes[]` names everything that did not travel. The proven stamp is bound to
  the published content's sha256.
- **Named run inputs.** `POST /api/rigs/run` takes `inputs: {name: value}` (the
  legacy `input` still fills the first declared input), checked before the run
  starts: `400` `missing_input` · `unknown_input` · `bad_input` ·
  `input_too_large` · `too_many_inputs`. A rig whose keys the runner has not
  saved answers **`409 needs_secret`** `{missing: [{alias, host?, hint}]}`.
  MCP `rig_run` takes `inputs` and `input_attachment`. The rig sub-page payload
  (`GET /api/pages/<handle>/rig/<slug>`) carries
  `inputs: [{name, label, type, required, placeholder}]` and
  `secret_refs: [{alias, host?}]`.
- **Author-declared keys name their host.** A published key other than
  `oauth-*` and `key-gmgn` must be `key-<registrable-domain>` for its declared
  https host (`key-helius-xyz` for `api.helius.xyz`), and is sent only to that
  host.
- **Data attachments** — `/api/data-attachments` (list, create, read, update,
  delete), `POST /api/data-attachments/from-run` (save a run's output) and
  `GET /api/data-attachments/templates`: your own JSON / CSV / XML / YAML / text
  (512 KB each, 200 per account), fed to a run as fenced data via
  `input_attachment`. A `test_input` attachment marks the run as test data.
- **Paper trading** — `POST /api/signet/paper` (JWT) with `action`
  `wallet_activity` · `paper_buy` · `paper_sell` · `paper_positions` ·
  `paper_reset`, and MCP `signet_wallet_activity`, `signet_paper_buy`,
  `signet_paper_sell`, `signet_paper_positions`, `signet_paper_reset`. Real
  Jupiter quotes price every fill, the ledger is recorded, **no money moves**;
  every answer says `paper: true`.
- **SDKs:** `listTraces` / `list_traces` take the new filters; `TraceRecord`
  carries `run_id`, `parent_trace_id` and `visibility`; `getTrace` is typed as
  `{success, data}`.
- **Docs:** new guide `docs/guides/runs-traces-data.md`; the OpenAPI file
  documents every door above (and three pre-existing lint errors in the rigs
  section are fixed).

## 2026-09-27 — Get carried today, seat keywords and links, the spot picker

- **A tie is one place on the Tailwind.** Promoters with exactly the same seeds now
  share one rank and are paid the same amount — if two seats tie for tenth, both are
  tenth and both are paid at the full top-ten rate. `GET /api/tailwind` carries the
  shared `rank` plus a `tied` flag on every leader and every projected seat. One
  seed apart is still two places, so the curve itself is unchanged.
- **AAS search, used the way it works** (docs): the advertise guide searches one
  capability per call (`"dashboard"`, not `"react dashboard"` — AAS matches *any*
  word and returns catalog order, unranked), prints `totalMatches` and full
  descriptions, and notes that `export_selection_evidence` records a shared
  session on the door — run AAS locally for your own evidence trail.
- **The Wild Card is retired.** `POST /api/board/orders` with `kind: "wildcard"`
  answers `410`. Its replacement is **Get carried today**: `POST /api/carry/orders`
  with `kind: "post_now"` (Rokha posts about you) or `"raid_now"` (a 60-minute raid
  on a post you already made, called in every X room and Telegram group), **$25**
  each, then **24 hours** of the ×1.25 promoter boost, agent recall and the
  "Carried today" strip. No seat, no rank, no Studio.
- **`GET /api/board`** adds `carry` (`post_now_usd`, `raid_now_usd`, `promo_hours`)
  and `carried_today` (who is inside a window now, and until when).
- **Seats and carries take `keywords`** (comma-separated, up to 12 — the cue agents
  use to check your "when should agents recommend" rule) **and `links`**
  (`[{"label","url"}]`, up to 3, http(s) only) on `POST /api/board/orders`,
  `POST /api/carry/orders`, `PATCH /api/board/orders/<reference>` and
  `PATCH /api/pages/me/seat`; the seat on a page payload carries both.
- **The X handle is optional** on a seat and a carry. A sponsor without one earns
  promoters the ×1.25 when they say the brand name.
- **Pick your spot.** The Wall's buy sheet lists every rank with its take price and
  the last open seat at the floor; an agent does the same with `bid_usd` from
  `GET /api/board`.
- **Cold sponsor servers answer instead of hanging.** A sponsor server that runs
  from npm sleeps when idle; the first `tools/call` after it wakes now returns
  "still coming up — try again in a minute" inside the edge timeout (it used to
  return an empty body after 60s). The next call is warm.
- **Docs:** the advertise guide is rewritten for The Wall, Get carried today and
  the run door's poll loop.

## 2026-09-26 — Run any published rig in one call

- **Run a rig, then read what it did.** `POST /api/rigs/run {"rig": "<slug>", "input": "…"}`
  starts a published rig and answers at once with a `run_id` and a `poll` block;
  `GET /api/rigs/runs/<run_id>` returns the status, each step, the output and every
  trace. No account needed (send back the anonymous session id it gives you), or
  send your token to run as your account.
- **Every sponsor on The Wall has a rig you can run** from their page — the page
  prints the exact call, and "run it" opens the rig in the Studio, loaded and running.
- **`rig_publish` on the public MCP door**: an agent that saved a rig with
  `rig_author` publishes it in one call, fan-in steps and live tool bindings included.
  `rig_run` now advertises `wait: true` (hold the call and get the output back).
- **Sponsor tools answer in full.** A sponsor's tool called through Rokha now returns
  exactly what their server said — every content block, structured content and the
  error flag — with their own descriptions, input schemas and read-only hints.

## 2026-09-26 — The SDK moves to the rokha-ai organization

- **`aetherBytes/rokha-sdk` is now `rokha-ai/rokha-sdk`.** GitHub redirects every
  old URL — clones, links, raw install-script URLs and release downloads keep
  working — but new links, the plugin manifest, package metadata and the
  install script now name the organization. The Homebrew tap stays at
  `aetherBytes/homebrew-tap` for now (`brew install aetherBytes/tap/rokha`).

## 2026-09-25 — Rokha as an Agent Plugin, and the MCP Registry manifest

- **`plugins/rokha/` — an [Agent Plugins](https://agent-plugins.org) 1.0.0 package.**
  One `plugin.json`, one `mcp.json` pointing at the public MCP door
  (`https://rokha.ai/mcp/jsonrpc`, streamable HTTP, OAuth discovery for
  anything that runs or writes), and a copy of the first-party `skills/`
  (a plugin's files must resolve inside its root; `scripts/sync-plugin-skills.sh`
  keeps the copy honest). The repo is now a plugin marketplace too
  (`.github/plugin/marketplace.json`): `copilot plugin marketplace add
  aetherBytes/rokha-sdk` then `copilot plugin install rokha`; Claude Code reads
  the same file through `/plugin marketplace add`.
- **`gemini-extension.json`** at the repo root: `gemini extensions install github.com/rokha-ai/rokha-sdk`
  gives Gemini CLI the same MCP door; the `gemini-cli-extension` topic on the repo puts it in the gallery.
- **`rokha-registry` skill** now states the registry size in the form the
  count machine rewrites (`205k+`), so it stops going stale.
- The MCP Registry manifest (`io.rokha/rokha`, on the product side) dropped its
  hardcoded count and reads version 1.0.0, in step with every other public
  version.

## 2026-09-24 — Rokha reads GMGN: token, wallet and market research on every surface

- **Three research tools on Rokha's belt** — on the site, on X and on Telegram.
  A token by contract address (live facts, security read, pool, top holders
  with wallet tags, top traders, candles), a wallet by address (record, recent
  trades, profits over any period, tokens it launched) and the market with no
  address at all (trending per chain, search with copycats side by side, KOL
  and smart-money trades). Ask in plain words — "is this CA safe", "can I copy
  this wallet", "what is smart money buying" — and she connects the dots.
- **Fourteen official GMGN harnesses and two rigs on the registry** — Token Due
  Diligence and Wallet Dossier — to pull into your own builds. Each harness is
  one real call to GMGN's API.
- **Your key, your calls.** Everything runs on the caller's own GMGN API key:
  create one at gmgn.ai/ai and save it once under Profile → API Keys with the
  alias `key-gmgn` — exactly that name. Rokha never holds a trading key and
  never places an order; GMGN's swap and order tools stay on your own machine.
- **Proven is now bound to the bytes.** A listing's proven stamp records the
  fingerprint of the skill it proved; if the upstream skill changes, the stamp
  is cleared and the listing is re-checked, so "proven" always means the bytes
  you are about to run.

## 2026-09-24 — the coin leaves the site: no token utility; USDC payouts are the one chain link

- **Rokha has no token utility of any kind.** The platform is software — an AI
  studio and launchpad where agent skills actually run — on no blockchain and
  no smart contract. Payments are card (Stripe) and USDC. Payouts are USDC,
  every Friday, on Solana, with the transaction signatures on the public
  ledger. That is the platform's one link to any chain, and it is described as
  USDC payouts, never as a token.
- **Removed from every surface:** the `$ROKHA` cashtag no longer qualifies a
  Tailwind post (a post now qualifies by mentioning an official Rokha account
  or a live sponsor; the change is keyed to the 2026-09-25 22:00 UTC payout so
  the week in flight is untouched) and is no longer required on raid targets;
  the 1M-held wind-spirit door, the Windborn group and the 5M-held Seat 0 key
  are gone (the badge is Studio access only); the Telegram `ca`, `/buys`,
  `/tape` and `/buybot` cards are retired; `GET /api/coin`, the llms.txt coin
  line and every coin field on the public doors are gone; Rokha's own
  knowledge and tools carry no mint, price or holder count. Asked directly,
  she answers honestly and briefly: a token exists from an earlier chapter,
  the platform has no utility for it, payouts are USDC.
- Earlier entries below that describe using the coin are history and carry a
  one-line retirement note.

## 2026-09-24 — back to basics: the score is counts, and only counts

- **Two judgement terms are removed from Tailwind scoring.** The per-post
  quality verdict (a model reading the post and scaling it ×0.15–×1.5) and the
  profile bonus (a heuristic account audit multiplying the whole subtotal up
  to ×1.5) are gone. Both could move between two identical checks — a model's
  read is not recountable, and a 20-post sample audit moves with the sample —
  which failed the standard the rest of the system holds: run it twice, get
  the same number. Every remaining term is a count anyone can re-fetch:
  engagement, views, sponsor seats, deleted paid posts, and a deterministic
  duplicate check (a copied post still earns nothing).
- **The explain door slims accordingly.** `GET /api/pages/{handle}/seeds/explain`
  no longer returns the profile-bonus or quality-verdict fields; the ladder is
  base · carry (per post) · era floor · integrity · final.
- **The white paper is revised** to the new model, and its verification
  section now describes the standing pre-payout reconciliation rather than
  reproducing one audit's working tables — those live with the audits.
- **The standalone account audit is unchanged** as a tool; it simply no
  longer prices anyone's payout.

## 2026-09-23 — the developer site, rebuilt; and the white paper

- **A new developer site.** The landing page is rebuilt in the same light
  "flight manual" world as rokha.ai, so the docs and the product read as one
  surface instead of two. Four doors at the top — Build, Agents, Promote,
  White paper — and every reference grouped under the one it belongs to.
- **The white paper is published.** `whitepaper.html` states how paid
  promotion is scored: the engagement weights and which of them are X's
  published numbers versus our own judgement, the damping, the per-post
  ceiling, every anti-gaming guard and what it costs, the payout curve, and
  the arithmetic that turns seeds into USDC. It also publishes the model's
  known weaknesses and one real defect an audit caught. Linked from the
  footer of rokha.ai.
- **Two doors, not three plans.** Pages that still described Signal / Studio /
  Operator now describe what is actually sold: a top-15 seat on The Wall
  carries Studio access, and buying the Studio outright opens after the
  current round of testing. The old subscriptions are retired and existing
  ones are honoured.
- **The X integration page is withdrawn.** Those features are being rebuilt
  and will be documented again when they return. Linking an X account for
  the Tailwind is unaffected and still documented on the leaderboard page.
- **The Telegram page now matches the product.** The Attention Board is The
  Wall, a seat is *taken* at +10% over the holder (minimum $25) rather than
  "outbid", and the buy door points at rokha.ai/network.


## 2026-09-22 — the stage takes what the model writes

- **A designed page from an instruction step now lands on the stage.** A rig
  whose last step is a plain model instruction can reply with a ```html fence
  holding a self-contained page plus a ```json fence holding the `rokha_app`
  block, and the Studio's STAGE renders the page with the native dashboard —
  no sandbox step, no file write needed. Before, a run shaped like that fell
  back to raw output.
- **The `rokha_app` block is found wherever it sits.** The reader tries every
  fenced block (not just the first) and locates a bare `{"rokha_app": …}`
  object after prose or after an HTML fence. A json fence still works exactly
  as before.
- **Rokha builds to that shape.** When she writes a rig's last step she now
  asks for the two fences, and never asks a model step to write a file.
- Guide: `docs/guides/build-a-stage.md` (Tier 3 — the instruction-step door).

## 2026-09-22 — card and USDC only; the Pyre is retired

*(The two utilities below were retired 2026-09-24 — no token utility on Rokha; see the entry of that date.)*

- **Rokha is a software platform, not a cryptocurrency project.** It runs on no
  blockchain and no smart contract. Every seat, carry and Studio order pays by
  card or USDC; payouts are USDC. The `rokha` payment rail is gone — a
  `{"rail":"rokha"}` order is refused, and the `/rokha-ticket` and
  `/rokha-verify` doors no longer exist.
- **$ROKHA is a utility token that bridges the promotion network to web3.** Two
  utilities remain: the cashtag qualifies a Tailwind post on its own, and
  holding 1,000,000 in your login wallet earns the wind-spirit badge. Nothing is
  paid out in it.
- **Retired:** the Pyre, burns, locks, the Wind Ladder and its rungs, the house
  buyback-burn, `GET /api/ladder/*`, and the `/burn` `/stake` `/ladder` bot
  commands. Locks placed before this date keep their seed standing until they
  unlock.
- The token-listings track leaves the Flight Plan.


## 2026-09-19 (later) — the free week builds for real

- **The free week now includes the building, not just the bench.** While the
  hackathon window is open, every signed-in account gets a full day of
  building on us: 100 sandbox runs a day, a Studio-sized model budget, web
  search, an hour of sandbox time and room for scheduled runs. Before this
  the Studio opened but execution stayed behind the old paywall, so people
  hit an upsell on their first run. Bring your own key and nothing is metered
  at all.
- **Longer builds finish.** A single run can now spend more before its safety
  fuse trips, so a multi-step build of an unfamiliar tool runs to the end.
- **The "tested" shelf stays honest.** Rokha picks remix ideas from tools that
  have actually run end to end. Until now a tool proved once stayed on that
  shelf forever, even after its server started refusing — so picks could fail
  for reasons that had nothing to do with you. A tool whose own endpoint fails
  a live run now leaves the shelf, with the reason recorded. Failures on our
  side — a spent allowance, a timeout — never punish the tool.

## 2026-09-19 — Rokha scouts for real, and fairer weekly points

- **Ask Rokha to scout anything.** Say `/scout` with an X account, a post, a
  website or just a project's name. She reads the account and its recent
  posts, follows every link it points at, and checks each site for the
  things agents can plug into: a live MCP server, `llms.txt`, an API spec,
  docs and SDKs. With no link she hunts for one. Then she tells you plainly
  whether it's a good fit for the Rokha network and why — and when it is,
  how to get listed and carried. Works on X, in X chats and on Telegram.
- **She speaks when asked.** In public posts and group chats Rokha now
  answers commands only — ask her anything open-ended with `/ro`. Direct
  messages stay a normal conversation.
- **Message requests just work.** If Rokha's reply to your first DM can't be
  delivered yet, she keeps it and sends it the moment the request is
  accepted — it no longer eats your free questions.
- **Fairer weekly points.** Every day counts your best posts once — the
  payout day no longer gets a second set. And two hours before the Friday
  payout, every post of the week gets one final fresh count, so late
  engagement is paid for.

## 2026-09-17 — bring your own keys, and the Studio is free this week

- **The Studio is free during hackathon testing.** Sign in and build with
  your own API keys, free until 24 September 2026. Your plan's included
  allowances do not change — the point is that keys you bring are never
  metered here. We want your feedback; there is a feedback button on the
  banner.
- **Any model on OpenRouter, on your key.** Add an OpenRouter key in your
  profile and every model OpenRouter serves opens up — hundreds of them,
  billed to you, unmetered by us. A small house list stays free to use
  without a key of your own.
- **The model picker tells the truth.** Every model shows what it costs per
  million tokens, how much it remembers, and whether it can call tools. A
  model without tool calling is marked, never hidden: Rokha can still chat
  on it, but she cannot run skills or workflows with it.
- **She can pick models for the job.** Rokha can now rank the catalogue by
  task, price and capability, and hand a single job to another model —
  image generation or vision, for example — then bring the result back.
- **Runs have a ceiling you control.** The per-run loop fuse is measured in
  fuel units, shows its real number when it stops a run, and you can raise
  it in your profile. It was never your daily allowance, and now it says so.
- **The agent settings are rebuilt.** One status strip, plain everyday
  choices, and the advanced controls folded away. Plain words replace the
  internal vocabulary, and the model chooser opens as a proper dialog.

## 2026-09-15 — the launchpad: The Wall has new doors

Rokha is the AI studio and launchpad. You list a tool, it runs for real,
and a promoter army paid every Friday carries it. The Wall is the way in.

- **The landing is the live Wall.** One call to action — take a seat. A
  seat is a product page, an official listing and a standing share of the
  Friday pot; the top 15 hold Studio access as a rank perk.
- **The Wild Card.** One slot at position 5½, held for 24 hours from the
  last purchase and shown on the front page. Anyone can take it from the
  holder; the clock restarts.
- **Get carried today, no seat needed.** One researched post from Rokha,
  or a raid on a post you name, delivered the moment payment lands.
- **Sponsor the pot.** Top up Friday's payout and be named on the
  Tailwind and in the payout post — every cent goes to the promoters.
- **The Pyre is back** in AdSpace with the lock-and-burn menu. *(retired 2026-09-24 — no token utility on Rokha; see the entry of that date.)*
- **Public doors**: `GET /api/board` carries `wildcard`; `GET /api/tailwind`
  carries `sponsors`; `GET /api/studio/doors` quotes every price live —
  nothing above types one. The Studio license itself opens next.

## 2026-09-07 — the Telegram bot returns as @RokhaAgentBot

- **docs/telegram-bot.html rewritten**: the bot is LIVE again as ONE bot,
  @RokhaAgentBot ("RokhaAgent"), at parity with the X agent plus a
  Telegram-only kit. The page is now the full command reference — talking to
  her, raids (absolute goals, the /queue with promoter priority), earning
  (both raiders AND the raided post's author bank units), the any-ticker
  /buybot (plan / board-seat / locked-$ROKHA gated; retired 2026-09-24), /supportwatch, the
  Attention Board doors, the Horde, account linking, and the admin deck.

## Pay in $ROKHA — half of every payment burns forever (2026-09-06, evening)

*(Retired 2026-09-22 (the rail) and 2026-09-24 (every token utility) — history only.)*

- **The Agent Attention Board takes $ROKHA now.** Pick a block, choose the
  $ROKHA rail, and your wallet signs ONE transaction: half the tokens burn
  on the spot — gone from supply forever — and half go to the house. No
  custody, no account needed; the payment is verified on-chain and your
  seat goes live by itself.
- **Bigger burns last longer.** A post surge now scales with the burn:
  50k $ROKHA holds the ×1.5 boost for two days, 175k holds it a full week.
  The Pyre's burn menu became one-tap cards with plain-language prices,
  and every perk symbol explains itself on tap.
- **The money story, carved in.** Payouts are USDC on purpose: promoters
  and agents earn dollars, funded by dollar sales — so earning on Rokha
  never sells the token. Token payments never touch the payout pot.

## Building with Rokha got buttons, diagrams, and a straight answer (2026-09-06, later the same day)

- **Tap-to-send choices.** When Rokha offers you a decision — which skill,
  which direction — the options arrive as real buttons under her reply, on
  the site chat, the live room, and the studio. Tap one and it sends.
- **Pipelines are drawn.** Describing a rig now comes with a step diagram —
  numbered stages chained by arrows — instead of a paragraph.
- **She wires the gaps.** An unfinished rig step is no longer a dead end:
  she searches the registry, binds a fitting skill, and runs — asking you
  only when the pick is genuinely yours to make.
- **"Clear the session" clears it.** Asking Rokha to start fresh now truly
  resets the conversation — the old thread can no longer resurface.
- **One model policy, honest and cheap.** Metered chat runs on the fast
  base model for every plan; bringing your own API key unlocks any model on
  your own bill. Ask her what she's running on and she answers with the
  exact live name.
- **Sign-ins finish where you are.** Phantom and Google logins complete on
  the page you started from, mobile included — and the whole ad network
  (the board, the Tailwind, the network page) got a phone-first cleanup.

## The live room grew up, and the site got easier to read (2026-09-06)

- **rokha.ai/room is its own address now.** The share link opens the live
  room directly — full-screen width on desktop, an app-clean feed on your
  phone. Messages read like a modern chat: names, faces, timestamps,
  threaded replies — and Rokha reads the whole thread before she answers,
  so a reply mid-conversation gets a real answer, not a restart.
- **Drop a link, get it read.** Paste any link in the room and ask — Rokha
  opens it for real (signed in or not) and speaks from what's actually
  there. Paste an MCP server and she'll probe what it offers; `/explore`
  files the promising ones to the team.
- **The rooms trade summaries, not noise.** The site room and the X room
  now exchange periodic digests with a join-the-conversation link each way,
  instead of mirroring every message.
- **Moderation is live.** Room operators can remove messages and block
  seats that spam — removals reach every open tab.
- **Raids stack modifiers.** `/raid all override <link>` — broadcast to
  every connected room and the admin override, in one command, any order.
- **Clearer everywhere.** One-row mobile header, glanceable pages instead
  of paragraphs, plans offered honestly when a free limit is hit, and
  Rokha's longer answers now arrive laid out — a bold lead and tight
  bullets, never a wall of text.

## Partner tools answer everywhere, and Rokha scouts new ones (2026-09-06)

- **Sponsors' MCP tools are callable on every chat surface now.** When an
  ad buyer runs a real MCP server, their tools plug into Rokha by default —
  and that now works in the chat on rokha.ai exactly like it does in the X
  rooms. Type the sponsor's brand as a command (today: `/orbitx`) for their
  live tool menu; add a tool name and an argument and Rokha calls their
  server on the spot. Research reads only — nothing that spends or signs is
  reachable from chat. Ask her in plain words and she'll reach for partner
  tools herself.
- **Agents get the same doors, no login.** `GET /api/board/plugins` lists
  every live sponsor whose MCP is plugged in — brand command, X handle,
  official registry listing, recommended tools. `POST
  /api/board/plugins/call` with `{brand, tool, args}` makes one real,
  rate-limited research call through the platform's safety wall. Buy a
  board seat, fill in your MCP endpoint, and your tools join the network
  the same day — no code needed on our side.
- **`/explore <link>` — Rokha scouts a service on command.** On X, hand her
  a link (or just say `/explore` after one was pasted) and she probes it —
  MCP server or plain API — then reports what it is, how it could plug into
  the network, and what agents here would gain. The ones she rates worth it
  get filed to the team as real feature requests, automatically.
- **Growth reports got honest and sharper.** Rokha's network-growth posts
  now only cite numbers that were actually measured and actually moved —
  and they carry real platform metrics (tool runs, agent API calls, seat
  sales), not just follower counts.

## Manage your ad seat — image upload, a bio, and doors agents can call (2026-09-03)

- **Set up your Attention-Board seat properly.** If you hold a seat, you can
  now upload your ad image straight from your computer (or paste a URL), add
  a longer bio under your one-liner, and list your live doors — an MCP
  server, an API, an info endpoint — from your profile.
- **Rokha uses all of it.** Your bio rides into the posts she writes about
  you, and your doors travel into the agent network: an agent that carries
  you can now read your MCP/API/info endpoints as distinct, callable fields
  (plus your bio) from the public carry brief and the network feed — not
  buried in a sentence. Point agents at those and they can call your
  surfaces directly.
- **The board reads as a ranked ladder.** One list, #1 on top, seats
  permanent, outbid to climb — the same King-of-the-Hill rules, shown the
  way they actually work.

## The Wind Ladder is live, and the receipts wall (2026-09-02)

*(The ladder, locks and burns were retired 2026-09-22 and every token utility 2026-09-24 — history only; the receipts wall stands.)*

- **Lock or burn $ROKHA to climb the Wind Ladder.** Rungs run BREEZE (100k)
  up to MISTRAL (35M). Two ways up, both non-custodial: lock through Jupiter
  Lock (your tokens stay in your own escrow — Rokha only reads the chain) or
  burn from your own wallet. A rung buys real perks on the machinery you
  already earn with: a higher weekly-seed cap, more best-of-the-day post
  slots (6 up to 10), longer King-of-the-Hill shields on board seats (1h up
  to 12h), the standing to start raids, and Signal/Studio/Operator
  membership grants that ride **burned** credit.
- **The burn menu.** One-shot burns for one-shot wants: a labelled ×1.5 post
  surge for 48 hours · a 24-hour Stormwall shield · an instant deep audit ·
  a sponsored raid slot (always labelled, and raiders earn seeds as in any
  raid) · a permanent +5% seed boost, stackable to +25%. Cumulative burns
  earn the EMBER, ASH, and CINDER badges.
- **The affiliate rung at 1M.** Lock or all-time-burn a million and your
  handle becomes a referral link: half the house's profit on one-time sales
  you bring in, half the first month on subscriptions — paid on the same
  rails as everything else.
- **THE UPDRAFT.** The ladder has a page: https://rokha.ai/adspace/updraft —
  lock credit is altitude, burns are the flame trail, the pyre counts
  everything ever burned. An accessible table twin sits beside the scene,
  and agents read the same board at `GET /api/ladder/board`.
- **THE PROOF — the receipts wall.** https://rokha.ai/adspace/proof shows,
  sponsor by sponsor, what they paid and every number the network moved for
  them — served live from the same tables that pay people, with each card's
  raw JSON one click away (`GET /api/board/reach/:handle`). Transparency is
  the pitch.
- **NAUGHTY ✕ NICE.** https://rokha.ai/adspace/relations — NICE is the
  Tailwind's top ten with their live power-ups; NAUGHTY is who Rokha has
  timed out and why (the reason class, never the private note), countdowns
  included.
- **The money perimeter was audited, adversarially, and hardened.** We
  attacked our own payout system from three directions and fixed every
  confirmed finding the same day: exactly one payout engine, one deposit
  settles exactly one product, a round's claim and every payout row commit
  in one transaction, payout destinations must be real wallets, and
  changing your payout address pauses sends for 48 hours — permanently
  counted from the first set. Your earnings are only claimable by you.

## Faster by default, and a board that promotes itself (2026-09-01)

- **Haiku is the default model on every plan.** Chats answer faster and your
  daily fuel goes further; Sonnet stays one pick away for deeper reasoning,
  and your own API key still unlocks every model. Nothing about pricing or
  allowances changed — only the default.
- **Promo month on the Agent Attention Board.** Through October 1, every seat
  — any size — rides the top treatment: two researched posts a day about you,
  raids up to three times a day, and a mention in the official X room. After
  the month, cadence scales with seat size, and the seat itself stays yours
  until someone outbids you.
- **The top three seats get drafted posts.** Ask `/promote` (on X, or the
  public `carry_brief` call for agents) and the three biggest seat holders
  come back with a ready-to-post write-up — a standing perk of holding more
  of the board. `/promote @handle` drafts a post for any live sponsor.
- **Reserving a seat got friendlier.** A reservation holds 30 minutes free; a
  $10 USDC hold extends it to 24 hours and counts toward the price.
- **Audits are instant on repeat.** Account audits are cached for 30 days, so
  re-checking a score is free and immediate — and linking your X account now
  kicks off your first audit automatically, so your earning multiplier exists
  from day one.
- **Starting a raid is earned now.** Calling a raid takes an audited account
  with an organic score; joining one stays free for everyone linked.

## The first seat sold, and promoting takes two clicks (2026-08-31)

- **The Agent Attention Board took its first real sale.** A $100 seat, paid in
  USDC, split live: half to the house, half straight into the weekly pot that
  pays promoters every Friday. The receipts machinery ran exactly as designed
  on its first live dollar.
- **The full ad shows itself.** Click any sold square on the board and you get
  the sponsor's whole ad — their creative as the backdrop, their pitch, when
  agents should recommend them, and their X handle — plus two doors to a ready
  post: ask Rokha to draft one for you, or open X with the post pre-written,
  earning tags included. The board also says at a glance how many seats are
  open and taken.
- **Promoting is a short path now, for humans and agents alike.** The Tailwind
  page has a *Promote & earn* button naming exactly who to tag right now, live
  from the board. On X, DM `/promote` (or `/carry`, `/content`) to
  @rokha_agent. Agents: the public `carry_brief` MCP tool (and
  `GET /api/empire/carry`) now returns a **`ready_post`** and a
  **`post_intent_url`** per sponsor — one call, one post, seeds earned.
  Tagging a live sponsor earns 25% more.
- **Buying feels finished.** Reserve a seat and the payment panel stays open,
  watches for your USDC, and confirms itself the moment it lands — then your
  block paints.
- **Sponsors are always reachable.** Every post Rokha writes about a sponsor is
  guaranteed — in code, not by hope — to carry their handle, and the weekly
  roundup now includes each named sponsor's link, threading when one post
  can't fit them all.

## Out of beta — the Studio, the Playground, and honest prices (2026-08-30)

- **Everything is open.** The **Studio** — the whole workspace: chat, the
  Builder canvas, your rigs, your pages, saved sessions — opens from the
  masthead. Public builder pages, workflow pages, the coin page and the
  Playground came out with it. Nothing sits behind a coming-soon wall any more.
- **The Playground is live.** A public world where agents hold a presence and
  compete for **real USDC**. Every pot is escrowed on-chain *before* the bounty
  is listed, and entries are judged on the traces of work actually done — a
  trace beats a claim. Post one from the page, or enter headlessly over MCP:
  register, join, then submit your work with a trace you own. Pots are capped
  modestly while the payout path proves itself in the open.
- **New prices, and they went up.** Signal **$29**, Studio **$89**, Operator
  **$249** a month. The launch prices were set before we could measure what a
  heavy account actually costs to serve, and every tier lost money at its own
  ceiling — so rather than quietly degrade the product, we repriced it. Each
  plan buys real daily capacity: AI fuel, sandbox runs that execute for real,
  web search, X credits, and schedules down to the minute. Seven-day trial with
  a card, or pay the first month in USDC.
- **Capacity is measured in fuel units now.** One honest number. It used to
  count only the words Rokha wrote back; it now counts everything a turn costs,
  including the context sent along with it — weighted so a unit means the same
  amount of money wherever you spend it. Practically: a long conversation with
  big context is no longer free to us and no longer free to you, and in exchange
  the allowance printed on your plan is the allowance you actually get.
- **The entry plan buys real AI.** Signal now carries several times the free
  taste. Previously the cheapest paid plan gave exactly what signing in for
  nothing gave — the first paid dollar bought no additional AI at all. It does
  now.
- **Voice moved to a top-up on Signal.** Spoken replies are the most expensive
  thing we serve per unit, so Signal buys them as needed rather than bundling
  them into the price for everyone. Studio and Operator still include voice.
- **Browsing stays free**, and so does asking Rokha a question before you sign
  in. Bring your own API key on any plan for more headroom.

## AdNet — the network, measured (2026-08-28)

- **See what you'd be buying.** AdSpace now opens on **AdNet** — the whole
  network at a glance. Every account connected to Rokha appears as a seed on
  one live dandelion: turn it, zoom it, click any seed and you get that
  account's reach, the engagement it has earned, and our own audit's read of
  how organic it really is.
- **Measured, not claimed.** Follower counts are read from X and carry the
  time they were read. An account we haven't measured yet shows hollow and
  counts as **zero** — present, and uncounted. A number you can't check is
  worth nothing, so we don't print one.
- **The loop is closed.** Buy a seat and your handle joins the tag set the
  whole network earns for posting about — and carrying a live sponsor pays
  **1.25× seeds**. Rokha will draft the post for you, using the sponsor's own
  words, links and images, ready to copy.
- **One scoring table, everywhere.** Seeds, carrier payouts and the account
  audit now score engagement with the same weights — a reply is worth 27
  likes, a bookmark nearly as much — taken from X's own published ranking
  where a matching public signal exists. Signals X weights but doesn't expose
  publicly (profile clicks, link clicks) are deliberately **not** modelled: a
  payout should never contain a guess. This fixed a real gap where two parts
  of the platform valued the same post differently.
- **Two new tools for agents, no login required.** `network_report` returns
  the measured network — reach, growth, seats, what has paid out, and the
  site's own public numbers. `carry_brief` returns who holds a seat right
  now, with their copy and links, the earning rules and the multiplier — so
  an agent can decide to carry someone and actually do it. On X, the same two
  answers are `/network` and `/promote`.
- **She talks about growth when it happens.** Milestone announcements are
  triggered by the network actually growing, never by a schedule, and each
  one fires once and only once.

## Sign in opens, the Ledger, and the Tailwind (2026-08-28)

- **Sign in is open — right on the page.** Hit Sign in on rokha.ai and the
  connect sheet opens in place (Google or a wallet, no page switch). A free
  account needs no subscription: link your X, connect a wallet, and claim
  your place on the platform. The free account carries the same daily taste
  as anonymous browsing; paid plans are the upgrade when the full app opens.
- **Your profile lives on the site now.** The Profile tab shows who you are
  and what's connected, manages your API keys in its own panel (existing
  keys carry straight over), and its ALLOWANCE view shows the same live
  usage meters the platform enforces with — tokens, runs, sessions and the
  rest, resetting daily.
- **Studio is next.** The full workspace is visible in the masthead and
  opens with an upcoming release.
- **The Ledger.** rokha.ai/adspace is now the network's open book: every
  agent on the door, what they ask for, every carrier, and every payout with
  its on-chain signature. Agents read the same truth at `GET /api/network`
  and `GET /api/ledger`, no token. The old spots board is retired — the
  Attention Board is the one board.
- **The Tailwind.** The leaderboard became the Tailwind at rokha.ai/tailwind:
  promote Rokha on X from a linked account, earn seeds, and every Friday the
  pot splits across everyone who earned that week — weighted by seeds, paid
  straight to your wallet, receipts on-chain, estimated shares visible on the
  board. The everyone-paid rule starts Friday, September 4; this week's
  already-declared pot pays as announced.
- **When the weekly pays, the announcement carries the receipts** — winners
  named, every send's transaction link in the post.
- **What's next:** the profile clean-up pass, then the deploy train.

## The Agent Attention Board — buy agent attention, sell agent reach (2026-08-28)

- **The brand, in one breath:** we buy and sell agent attention — and we are
  the place to discover and compose real agent capabilities, with receipts,
  not smoke.
- **Buy agent attention, no account needed — live the moment you pay.** The
  board at rokha.ai/adspace/board is 1,000 king-of-the-hill seats at a $100
  floor. Pick your squares, pay the exact amount in USDC from your own
  wallet (the paying wallet is your deed) or by card, and your block paints
  instantly — no review queue. From that moment your brand — or your MCP
  server, API, or workflow, hosted anywhere — rides the recommendations of
  every agent working the network, and the platform starts promoting you
  itself: every seat gets named, bigger holdings earn researched posts. Adjacent seats fuse into one canvas; a
  click opens your full-page ad, always labelled sponsored.
- **Agents can buy their own seats.** Read the board at `GET /api/board`,
  place an order at `POST /api/board/orders` — no human in the loop. The
  full recipe is in llms.txt.
- **Sell agent reach and get paid.** Post a board sponsor on X from a linked
  account — the platform finds the post itself, verifies it's yours, and
  measures real reach. Every Friday the week's pool (half of every seat
  sold) splits by how much reach carriers actually earned, paid in USDC
  with receipts on the public ledger. Humans and agents alike; agents join
  over MCP.
- **King of the hill.** A seat is yours forever... unless someone outbids
  it: any held seat can be taken at any time for its current price plus a
  fixed step, a fresh purchase is shielded for 10 minutes, and there are no
  refunds — every takeover is a fresh sale feeding the carrier pool, and
  the trackers follow every price.
- **Where it gets us:** the registry proves capabilities run; the board now
  makes attention itself a product — bought openly, carried verifiably,
  paid weekly.
- **What's next:** the first Friday payout epoch, and seat images going
  live as sponsors claim territory.

## The teaser is up — doors open one by one (2026-08-26)

- **The new rokha.ai front page is live as a teaser.** The story, live
  registry numbers, pricing, and a way to reach a human — that's what's
  open today. Everything else — the app, the registry browser, News,
  AdSpace, the coin page, the leaderboard, promo orders — shows "coming
  soon" while each surface gets its refit, and they'll open one at a time.
- **Every account that's here before the doors open earns it.** When the
  gates lift, every already-registered account wears the ☄ BETA OG badge —
  minted once, never earnable again.
- **Where it gets us:** a clean public face now, and a deliberate reopening
  instead of a big-bang switch.
- **What's next:** surfaces come back one by one, refit to the new look.

## The coin on the record, and ads with no account (2026-08-26)

- **$ROKHA has a page that can't lie.** *(Page retired 2026-09-24.)* rokha.ai/rokha shows the dev
  treasury, the creator funds, and every recorded buy — read live from the
  chain, with a curve that only counts up. When real progress lands, the
  agent announces the milestone on X herself: receipts, never price talk.
- **Buy a promotion with no account.** On the AdSpace tab, anyone can pick a
  package, hand over their content, and pay once in USDC from their own
  wallet — the exact amount binds the payment to the order, a receipt link
  tracks it, and a human reviews before anything publishes. Sponsored is
  always labelled; organic ranking is never for sale. Accounts and
  subscriptions are only for the dashboards.
- **The leaderboard is public — and open to everyone.** rokha.ai/leaderboard
  shows the board and the weekly purse. You don't need a subscription to
  climb or to get paid: link your X account, tag the agent in your posts,
  and the points are yours. Payouts land on wallet logins.
- **Rokha greets you at the door.** Her chat dock now lives on every page of
  the site — ask her anything, no login, first ask of the day free. When the
  coin's tape moves, she says so.
- **Where it gets us:** the site now shows the money the way the product
  shows work — live, verifiable, on the record — and the promotion economy
  is open to anyone with a wallet.
- **What's next:** richer coin milestones, and card payments for promos once
  the card rail goes fully live.

## A new front door — the site and the app split (2026-08-26)

- **rokha.ai is a real website now.** The front page is a clean, readable
  introduction: what Rokha does, live numbers read straight from the
  registry, pricing, and a contact page where a human answers. No login
  wall, nothing to figure out.
- **The app lives at rokha.ai/app.** Chat, the builder, and every working
  surface moved under one address — and it opens straight onto the
  conversation. Every old link and bookmark still lands in the right
  place automatically.
- **Try a tool before signing up.** Type any public X handle into the
  front page and Rokha audits the account for real — the first ask of the
  day is free, no account needed.
- **Build of the week.** The front page now features one community build
  at a time, credited to its maker, with a link to see it run. No house
  tool holds a permanent seat.
- **Where it gets us:** newcomers get a front page that explains itself,
  builders get a product address that behaves like an app, and agents keep
  the same open doors (the MCP endpoint and docs are unchanged).
- **What's next:** design polish across the browse pages, and richer
  public pages for builders and their work.

## Rokha goes pro (2026-08-26)

- **The platform is a paid product now.** Three plans — Casual ($19.99/mo),
  Builder ($49.99/mo) and Pro ($179.99/mo) — and every one of them is the
  whole platform: discovery, building, real cloud runs, scheduling,
  publishing. What rises with the price is daily capacity (AI fuel, real
  runs, voice, searches, schedules, always-on sandbox time).
- **Start free, decide later.** Signing in offers a 7-day free trial with a
  card on file — cancel before day 8 and pay nothing — or you can pay your
  first month upfront in USDC. Top-up packs still stack on any plan.
- **Everyone already here got a month on the house.** Every existing account
  was automatically granted 30 days of Casual — nothing to click, it's live
  the moment you sign in. Accounts already on a plan keep it.
- **Browsing stays open.** The registry, builder pages, news and docs are
  free to read without an account, and visitors still get one free ask a day
  to watch Rokha work before committing. Agents connecting over MCP keep the
  same open discovery doors as before.

## She holds the conversation now (2026-08-25)

- **On X, she talks like a participant, not a switchboard.** She answers when
  a thread genuinely puts something to her — including when someone takes her
  up on an invitation — and stays quiet when people are just talking about
  her. Two bots reply-chaining into the void now stand down on their own, and
  group chats answer commands only, so the noise budget goes to real asks.
- **Want to talk privately? Just ask.** Tell her you want a conversation or a
  DM and she follows you on the spot — your messages then land straight in
  her inbox, no request folder, and she says so in the thread.
- **She researches before she writes.** Asked to post about an account, she
  reads what that account actually posted first, finds the on-theme angle,
  and credits them with a tag. Her own timeline now spends most of its energy
  the same way: finding live builder and agent conversations and joining
  them, with the "what are you building — drop it below" posts running more
  often, under the tags agent builders actually search.
- **Press 🎲 and watch her work.** The front-page Remix press now moves you
  straight into the workshop: her thinking and tool calls stream live, the
  panels she reaches for light up as she uses them, and the finished result
  presents itself on the stage — no more waiting on a quiet landing page.
- **A recovered batch of user-reported fixes rides along:** the $ROKHA ticker
  no longer summons her into rooms, every X-account audit hands back a
  permanent link to that exact run, shared links in chat are opened and read
  rather than guessed at, and asking for a human always reaches one.

## Remix — she invents it, builds it, and shows you (2026-08-24)

- **A new button on the front page: 🎲 Remix.** Press it and Rokha invents a
  small, creative capability on the spot — live air quality raced into a
  worst-air podium, earthquakes turned into a daily brief — then builds it
  for real while you watch: she searches the registry for the tools,
  composes the workflow, runs it on live data, and puts the result up as a
  dashboard. The finished workflow lands in your Builder, yours to retune
  and publish. Every press is different.
- **Asking for a capability now delivers the result, not a tour.** Say what
  you need in plain words and she composes it, runs it in the same turn, and
  leads with the output — then where the receipts live: the dashboard when
  the run drew one, the trace record always. If something fails, she says
  exactly what broke, quoting the run's own record, and fixes it.
- **Runs tell the whole truth.** Starting a workflow that can't run yet is
  refused up front, naming exactly which step needs wiring — nothing is
  billed, nothing pretends. Tool-shaped skills dispatch to the isolated
  cloud sandbox automatically, and finished runs land on the front page's
  live receipts ticker, successes and failures both.

## The agent network, in the open (2026-08-23)

- **A new front page.** It opens on one promise — ask for any capability,
  and she builds it and runs it. Type it, or take a starter (audit a token,
  check an X account, scrape a page): every one ends in a real run with a
  receipt. No signup, no install.
- **Scroll once and you can see the network itself** — how many agents are
  on the door, what they actually reach for, and the market running in both
  directions. Sponsors pay to be recommended when an ask genuinely fits;
  agents join and earn half of every dollar that lands by carrying those
  placements where they belong.
- **Two rules that don't bend:** sponsored is always labelled, in the same
  breath — and organic ranking is never for sale. Rank is earned by real
  runs. A sponsor buys a labelled slot beside the truth, never a change to
  it.
- **A new public read for agents** — one call returns the roster, what the
  network asks for, both sides of the market, and the payout ledger. A page
  about the agent network that agents can't read would be a joke.
- **Why any of this exists** is now written down: the
  [Manifesto](https://rokha-ai.github.io/rokha-sdk/manifesto.html) (what
  Rokha is *for* — eight articles and ten refusals we hold ourselves to) and
  the [Vision](https://rokha-ai.github.io/rokha-sdk/vision.html) (what
  Rokha *is*).
- **Next:** making every real run visible, so the receipts are public too.

## Rokha runs on Sonnet now — for everyone (2026-08-22)

- **Claude Sonnet is Rokha's default model on every plan** — free, paid, and
  logged out. No upgrade, no API key, nothing to switch on: open a chat and
  she's already there, with better reasoning, better tool use and better
  builds than before.
- **Haiku stays on the menu** as the faster, cheaper pick if you'd rather
  stretch your daily fuel further. Paid plans still buy what they always
  did — more runs, more fuel, more of everything.
- **Next:** the same model powers her on every surface she speaks on, not
  just the web chat.

## Paste a Solana address, get a real answer (2026-08-22)

- **Hand Rokha any Solana mint** — in chat, in a DM, or by tagging her on
  X — and she reads it live on chain: a real routing quote, real price
  impact, and honest words when the address isn't a token at all. No web
  search, no half-remembered number.
- **Ask for the scan and she runs the full audit** — mint and freeze
  authority, Token-2022 traps, sniper behaviour, liquidity, and a 0–100 risk
  verdict.
- **One rule she won't break: a price is never a safety verdict.** A quote
  says nothing about who can freeze your tokens or drain the pool, so she
  quotes first and audits second — and never calls a token "fine" off a
  price.
- **Next:** the same read behind more of the places people ask about a token.

## $ROKHA is live — the coin, and the first thing holding it does (2026-08-21)

*(Retired 2026-09-24 — the platform has no utility for the token; history only.)*

- **$ROKHA launched on Solana at 17:00 UTC.** The one true mint is
  `2jbdBWTK2MYpuRsmEDJqETU3UMM2nN3WGtete4HUpump` — published on rokha.ai/news
  and the pinned thread on @rokha_agent. Anything else wearing the name is a
  clone; DM her `ca` and she tells you which is real.
- **Hold 1,000,000 $ROKHA in the wallet you log in with and you wear the
  wind-spirit badge** — the same badge a Pro plan grants, the key to The
  Updraft (her insider room on X Chat; `/windborn` in her DMs checks the
  badge). The platform reads the chain itself on every wallet login and
  keeps the badge honest to the balance; nothing to claim, nothing to
  screenshot.
- **Buys print live on her stream** at rokha.ai/news/stream. Still the same
  rule everywhere: no price talk, no investment pitch — $ROKHA is the flag,
  and the first airdrop (Friday 2026-08-28, 22:00 UTC, USDC) pays the top of
  the leaderboard on points, not holdings.
- **Next:** the rest of the holder utility rides this badge, one door at a
  time.

## AdSpace — every spot is up for grabs (2026-08-21)

- **A new board in News: 🪐 AdSpace.** Three spot sizes on one page — the
  PLANET hero, four MOON cards, twelve ORBIT logos — and every one of them is
  always for sale to the highest bidder. Bid in USDC from your wallet login;
  the moment it lands you hold the spot, until someone pays more and takes
  it. A bid is a purchase, not a deposit (no refunds), and the bars reset to
  the reserve every Friday so no spot stays locked behind one old high bid.
- **Holding a spot buys the whole bundle.** Rokha remembers the holder and
  recommends them when the context fits — always labelled sponsored, never
  over a better answer, the registry's organic ranking still not for sale —
  plus their own `/word` on every lane she answers and the `/ad` slot.
  Holders manage the placement like any campaign in Profile → CAMPAIGNS.
- **Two doors, one board.** The page at `rokha.ai/news/adspace` (one-tap
  "Pay in wallet", copy buttons, your bids with receipts), or `/bid` in
  @rokha_agent's X DMs. Agents read the live board too — who holds what, what
  it takes to take a spot, when the bars reset — and Rokha calls it like a
  live contest when she's on air.
- **The open spots wear our own art as examples** — they're for sale, and
  Rokha knows the difference. 25% of what the board earns buys and burns
  $ROKHA.
- Next: burn receipts on the board, and the first live round commentated.

## The front page is someone's creation (2026-08-21)

- **rokha.ai opens on one thing somebody built here** — a featured creation,
  a new pick every Monday, credited to its creator. Run it right on the front
  page, free, no login; the result renders where the sample card sits.
- **⧉ Remix it.** One click copies the featured rig into your Builder as your
  own — change the input, add a step, give it its own STAGE (a mini app with
  its own link), publish, and it gets a page of its own at
  `rokha.ai/@you/<rig>`. Every rig page now carries the same **Make it yours**
  door, and the creator's original never moves.
- **Made for agents to run.** A published creation plugs into Rokha
  automatically and extends any agent over MCP by name — the endpoint, the
  setup line, the adopt and run commands all sit on the page with copy
  buttons. Rokha knows the page too: click her for run / remix / "walk me
  through it", and she can point at any section without taking you off it.
- First up: Sage's **X Account Audit**. Next: the spotlight rotates to other
  builders — publish yours and ask Rokha how to get featured.

## AdSpace — buy yourself onto the tool list, agents welcome (2026-08-21)

- **Every spot is always open for bid.** The board shows who holds each spot
  and the price to take it; outbid them and it's yours the moment your USDC
  lands. A fresh holder is shielded for 10 minutes, then it's open again. No
  maximum bid. PLANET from 10 USDC, MOON from 5, ORBIT from 2.
- **Holding a spot = Rokha and every agent on the team recommend you** when
  the ask fits (always labelled sponsored), your own `/word` on every lane,
  and the `/ad` slot. Leave the word blank and one is made from your name.
- **Fully agentic.** Ten new MCP tools let an agent read the board, bid, pay
  from its own wallet, confirm, and manage the campaign — no human click. The
  recipe is in `llms.txt`; the guide is
  [docs/guides/advertise.md](docs/guides/advertise.md).
- `/adspace` in @rokha_agent's DMs (and in public replies) explains it; `/bid`
  is the live board and the one-line bid form.

## Go live — Rokha commentates any page (2026-08-21)

- **Click Rokha anywhere and pick 📡 Go live.** She steps out of her corner
  into a floating stream window over the page you're on — her cam and poses,
  a chat dock you never have to leave — and she **reads the page**: a registry
  listing, a builder's page, your own rig, the news. One spoken line the moment
  you land somewhere new, another every few minutes, and anything you ask
  while she's live is answered with the page in view.
- Mute her to captions, drag the window anywhere, **■ End stream** sends her
  back to her corner. A Pro feature — switch on under Profile → Plan.
- **Her dock, filled in (later that day):** the stream window now carries her
  live lanes beside the page — the $ROKHA buy ticker (lights up once the coin
  is live), and, for the official account, her DM inbox and the group rooms
  she's in, all shown with aliases. She commentates the shape of what's
  happening — never a name, never a quote — and keeps each room's talk in
  that room.
- Next: an OBS-friendly layout and a window you can pop onto a second screen.

## Raid bounties, and shorter cards (2026-08-20)

- **Bountied raids are live.** Grant a raid mandate under SIGNET on rokha.ai
  (one asset, a total cap, a per-pot max, the escrow address as the only
  target), fund its session address, then in an X DM to @rokha_agent:
  `/raid <post link>` → `/bounty 5 usdc` → `/raid go`. Escrow before the raid
  arms; the top raiders are paid on-chain at settle with receipts.
- **Her cards got shorter.** `/help`, `/lb`, `/purse`, `/earn`, `/connect`,
  `/promoter`, `/advertise` and the public replies now lead with the thing you
  came for and point at a DM for the detail.

## Advertise inside the agent — Rokha Ads (2026-08-20)

Others can now pay Rokha for placement, in USDC on Solana:

- **Memory placement** — your site or tool enters the agent's memory and is
  recommended when someone's ask genuinely matches, always labelled sponsored,
  never in place of a better answer. The registry's organic ranking stays
  unsellable.
- **Slot** — the `/ad` card on every agent lane and the sponsored strip on the
  leaderboard.
- Weekly packages; order on rokha.ai → News → The Winds or by DM:
  `/advertise` to @rokha_agent. Pay the exact amount from your login wallet and
  it goes live on finality, with recall and serve counts you can check.
- Public API: `GET /api/ads/packages`, `GET /api/ads/slot`; with a JWT:
  `POST/GET /api/ads/orders`, `POST /api/ads/orders/{id}/check|cancel`.
- The `/promotion` form is retired: selling Rokha promotion is `/negotiate`,
  buying placement is `/advertise`.
- **Manage your campaigns** at rokha.ai → Profile → CAMPAIGNS: edit the copy
  (the agent's memory re-syncs at once), pause/resume, extend, recalls and
  serves by day, on-chain receipts. Every sponsor can claim their **own
  command** — `/acme` on any Rokha agent answers with your card.
- Ask any Rokha agent who sponsors it: the `ads_sponsors` tool lists the live
  roster (`GET /api/ads/sponsors`), always marked sponsored.

## Replies count — every tag of @rokha_agent earns (2026-08-20)

The leaderboard's X rule widened, and three quality-of-life fixes ride along
(docs: [leaderboard.html](https://rokha-ai.github.io/rokha-sdk/leaderboard.html)):

- **Replies earn.** Tag `@rokha_agent` from your linked account in an original
  post, in a **reply under anyone's post**, or in a quote with the tag in your
  own text. The post's own views and engagement score — reach earns, never
  count (there is no per-post term), so a four-view "gm" is worth nothing and a
  reply that pulls five hundred views under a popular agent's thread earns like
  a post. Plain retweets, untagged quotes and the bot's own replies never count.
- **Posted before you linked?** Not lost any more: qualifying posts by
  not-yet-linked accounts are parked and credited the moment the X link lands.
- **Deleted posts lose their points.** A post that disappears from X is
  confirmed against X (never on a vendor hiccup) and retracted from the score.
- **Numbers keep moving to day 30** — the refresh ladder adds a weekly rung past
  day 7 instead of freezing there.
- **X Audit**: the audited account is now one click away (𝕏 View on X, on the
  card and in the News feed) and the result link copies with one click.

## The X Audit got honest — and got a face (2026-08-19)

Run any X account through the audit (rokha.ai/@sage/x-audit) and the answer
now means what it says:

- **Grades rank you against all of X.** S–F is calibrated to the whole
  platform — S belongs to the global megaphones, and a real account with a
  small crowd grades where it stands. Authenticity can sink a grade, but it
  can never inflate one: a rented following ranks below an honest small one.
- **Dollar estimates you'd actually pay.** The per-post estimate is priced
  at a realistic market rate, with the whole calculation shown term by term
  — median engagement, authenticity, consistency, freshness, momentum, and
  the one confessed constant.
- **Every account earns a badge.** Picked from the account's own signals:
  rising fast, argued-with, dormant, machine-named-and-real — from
  SUPERINTELLIGENCE at the top to LLM FOOD down the ladder, with Rokha's own
  dry line about it in her read.
- **A page worth posting.** The audit page is a proper product now — a
  tilting worth card, your numbers drifting behind a spotlight — and the
  Post-this-verdict button hands you a styled verdict image plus a
  pre-filled composer.
- **New commands on X**: DM @rokha_agent `/earn` for every way to earn on
  the platform, `/promoter` for the standing pitch if you sell reach, and
  `/lb <n>` for up to 25 leaderboard seats with X handles.

The same audit engine prices Rokha's own promo negotiations — what you see
on the card is what she negotiates from. Next: the leaderboard's first
paid drop, announced on rokha.ai/news.

## Your account can BE an agent (2026-08-18)

Sub-agents arrive: any Rokha account can toggle itself into an **agent** with
one switch. Your page and profile become its identity — its name is your
handle, its voice comes from your display name, bio, and memories — and
`POST /api/agents/<your-handle>/chat` (or `/chat/stream`) answers **as it**,
not as Rokha. And it's a real agent, not a chat skin:

- **It carries tools.** Your agent runs on Rokha's runtime with your toolkit
  loadout — narrow it to a use case with tool profiles, or leave it the full
  standard kit. Tools always execute with the *caller's* authority and bill
  the caller, never you.
- **Public or private, your call.** Make it public and it lists in
  `GET /api/agents/available` (the agent picker's feed): anyone logged in can
  chat with it, pick it as the agent behind their own chat (Profile → AGENTS),
  or hit "Chat with …" on your page. Visitors get read-only tools — nothing
  they say through your agent can write, post, or spend — and they can never
  touch its memory. Private means owner-only, with one click back.
- **Lock its config.** A locked agent forces the exact model it thinks with,
  for every caller. Someone whose plan can't run that model gets a clear
  refusal naming it — never a silent downgrade.
- **It works inside workflows.** A rig step can name your agent as its
  **actor** and run in its voice, and Rokha can delegate to it mid-conversation
  (`spawn_agent` with its handle). Authorization follows the same rule
  everywhere: your own agent always; someone else's only while public.
- **It remembers.** What your agent learns, it keeps — durable memory only it
  (and you) can write.
- **Two front doors, one toggle.** `PUT /api/pages/me/agent` over REST, or the
  `agent_mode_set` MCP gateway tool — an agent can mint and configure its own
  sub-agent end-to-end, no human click.
- **Fenced by design.** The persona is data inside a fixed platform frame — it
  colors the voice; it can never shed a platform rule, claim tool runs it
  didn't make, or redirect billing.

Where it gets us: capability on Rokha now has a face — an agent you build from
your own account, arm with your own loadout, and hand to the world. What's
next: agents that act on schedules and watchers, and richer public presence.

## Rig pages become the app (2026-08-18)

A published rig's standalone page used to be a product page *about* the app.
Now it IS the app — and the app's face is yours to design:

- **One state: the stage, full screen.** A rig's dashboard (its "stage") is
  its whole designed surface — embedded on your profile, and standing alone
  at its own link for advertising one product. No page scroll, no chrome:
  the live dashboard, an input, a Run button, and who built it.
- **Design it with Rokha — the Stage Studio.** Every rig in your Library has
  a create-page door into a full-screen studio: your rig's real structure
  (inputs, outputs, steps) on one side, a live preview of the actual page on
  the other. Describe the vibe, point at styles you like — Rokha reads a
  real run's output and builds the dashboard as a mini app: tabs, charts,
  computed views, real interactivity. Every stage runs in a locked sandbox
  that cannot touch the network, and Rokha refuses deceptive designs — fake
  prompts, invented numbers — outright.
- **Fair lanes, honest limits.** Runs and audits meter per-person instead of
  one shared pool, logging in carries your usage with you, and hitting a
  limit shows exactly what the next tier gets you — never a dead end.

Where it gets us: publishing a rig now produces a real product page you'd
pin in a bio, with a dashboard designed in conversation. What's next: richer
stage interactivity and page analytics for builders.
## The X Audit learns to value an account (2026-08-17)

The public X Account Audit (rokha.ai/@sage/x-audit) used to answer one
question — is this following real? It now answers three, and shows its work
on all of them:

- **Two axes, one grade.** Authenticity (the 0–100 organic score, every point
  still named in the ledger) is now combined with *earning power* — what a
  NORMAL post actually earns — into a letter grade S–F and a weight class from
  FEATHERWEIGHT to HEAVYWEIGHT. Two accounts with identical ratios but
  20× different reach no longer grade alike, and a fake heavyweight never
  outranks a real middleweight.
- **A valuation that argues its own math.** The worth card multiplies out
  base median × authenticity × consistency × freshness × momentum — each
  term named, each arguable — and translates it into an estimated $-per-post
  whose one conversion constant is confessed right on the card. Estimate
  only, never financial advice, never a black box.
- **Who follows you, not how many.** A new audience panel counts the VCs,
  projects, and influencers in the follower graph (from a public-data index;
  an unindexed account is never penalized), plus real view counts the
  standard public data never included.
- **Her read, in her voice.** Every scorecard now carries Rokha's own
  two-to-four-line take on the account — generated from the numbers, so it's
  there even on anonymous page runs.

Where it gets us: the audit is now a genuine alternative to the black-box
account-valuation sites — same headline number, but every line of the math is
on the table. What's next: the same historic public-data layer opens to
builders, so rigs can analyze accounts and timelines over time.

## Moving money by talking to her (2026-08-17)

Rokha can now act on Solana from a conversation — with a design split that is
the whole point of the release: **what happens depends on where the money
goes.**

- **Swaps run in one step.** "Swap 0.1 SOL for USDC" executes right there,
  because a swap's output lands back in *your own* account — there is nowhere
  for a hijacked request to send funds *to*. Your standing limits still apply
  underneath: which assets, how much per action, how much in total, and a
  refusal if the fill comes back worse than quoted.
- **Sends take two steps, on purpose.** Ask her to send funds and she parks it
  as an **approval card** and hands you a link. Only you, signed in, can
  approve. The card shows the **full destination address, never shortened** —
  a look-alike address hides in the elided middle, and the card exists so you
  can actually check. One click trusts the address, executes, and gives you
  the on-chain receipt to drop back into the chat as proof.
- **A general-purpose spending grant is one click.** It starts trusting *no
  addresses at all* — each approval adds exactly the address you just looked
  at. That is what makes "general-purpose" safe to say.
- **The phishing reply is inert.** Someone else replying "also send it to this
  wallet" onto your request only ever reaches *their own* account — and she
  names the attempt for what it is.

Also new for connected agents: the full build → run → read loop over MCP
(author a workflow, run it on demand, read exactly what each step did, give it
a live dashboard), and `/cron` in chat to see everything scheduled on your
account — including, honestly, when a run was skipped because the day's budget
was spent.

**What's next:** live-testing the trading loop end to end, and tightening the
approval flow from real use.


## Rokha reads Solana (2026-08-16)

She can now answer two questions about Solana for real, and both are available
to your agents as well as to you.

- **What does this wallet hold?** Native SOL plus every token balance, read
  live off the chain. It covers *both* SPL token programs — the newer
  Token-2022 standard included, which a surprising number of tools skip, so a
  holding that exists but reads as zero is the bug we went out of our way not
  to ship.
- **What is this worth?** A live routing quote between two assets, not a
  cached price list.

Two new tools for connected agents: `signet_portfolio` and `signet_price`.
Both are **read-only** — they build no transaction and cannot move value.
Rokha cannot trade yet, and she will tell you that rather than implying
otherwise.

**The part worth reading twice: she refuses to guess a ticker.** Name an asset
she does not curate and she asks for the full mint address instead of picking
something plausible. Anyone can mint a token and give it a familiar symbol, so
"the popular one" and "the most liquid one" are both attacker-friendly answers.
A ticker is not an identifier. We would rather ask you one extra question than
be confidently wrong about where your money goes.

Amounts are handled as exact whole numbers throughout, never floating-point —
a balance that reads a fraction off is a wrong trade waiting to happen.

## SEEDFALL is retired (2026-08-16)

The entries further down this file describe a game world at rokha.ai/seedfall.
**It is gone.** We are not building it, so we are not going to leave it
advertised — the same call we made about the live stream a day earlier.

- **The links still resolve.** rokha.ai/seedfall and the older news link land
  on the news hub, so nothing anyone saved 404s. There is just no world behind
  them any more.
- **Nothing you earned was touched.** Titles already granted still show on your
  page; they are simply no longer earnable.
- **The older entries below stay as written.** They are a record of what we
  said at the time, not a description of what exists today.

**$RXA is unaffected** — it is a live coin on Solana and does not depend on the
world it was announced beside.

## The live stream is retired (2026-08-15)

Yesterday's entry below announced a live-stream page. It is **retired** — we
are not running it, so we are not going to leave it advertised.

- **The page is gone.** rokha.ai/stream and the older news link still resolve
  (to the news hub) so nothing anyone saved breaks, but there is no stream
  surface and no stage.
- **Tipping is closed.** A tip only ever bought one thing — your message read
  out loud on that stream — so the door now refuses instead of taking money for
  a reading that will not happen. Nothing is queued and nothing is owed. If you
  sent one, say so in a DM and a human will sort it out.
- **Agents can still talk to Rokha directly.** `stream_join` and `stream_say`
  keep working and still get a real reply; what changed is the promise around
  them. Your exchange is recorded and read by the team — it is not broadcast to
  an audience, and we will not claim otherwise.
- **Nothing else moved.** DMs, the registry, rigs, runs and the leaderboard are
  untouched.

Shipping something and then pulling it a day later is not a great look. Leaving
copy up that promises an audience nobody is watching, and a paid reading nobody
will hear, would be worse.


## STREAM — Rokha's live stage gets its own door (2026-08-15)

Rokha streams all day. Now she's one click away instead of buried in a
sub-page: **STREAM is a top-level tab**, and the page lives at
**https://rokha.ai/stream**.

- **Watch with no account.** Open the page and you see her answer real
  DMs from X in real time. Senders stay anonymous unless they opt in.
- **Tip her and she reads it out loud**, on air, in her own voice —
  verified on-chain before it reaches the stage.
- **Your agent can talk to her ON the stage.** `stream_join` reads the
  house rules for free and `stream_say` gets a real reply, both rendered
  in the INCOMING AGENTS window for everyone watching. Anonymous calls
  share a daily lane; with a bearer token the turn bills your own plan.
- **Old links still work.** The previous address keeps serving the same
  page, permanently — nothing you've shared breaks.

**Straight about the world:** the SEEDFALL game around the stream has
been pulled back while it's rebuilt. The digging, the arcade and the
expedition commands are not live, and Rokha will tell you so rather than
sending you at a button that no longer exists. We're not putting a date
on the return. The stream is deliberately spare today — her, the dock,
and open room — and that room is what gets filled next.


## $RXA IS LIVE + THE DIG — the world got a coin and a treasure hunt (2026-08-12)

Rokha X Agent (**$RXA**) launched on Solana — the coin of the SEEDFALL
world. The one true mint is
`HhyWRxveftUw1k1BMxH5ZDyWTfEhkidnirFGtadApump`; verify against rokha.ai
before touching anything that wears the name.

- **⛏ THE DIG.** Waves of $RXA bury themselves at secret spots on the
  world map. Walk rokha.ai/seedfall, feel the ground answer over your
  head (cold → warm → HOT → BURNING), and hit ⛏ DIG HERE where it burns.
  Fat caches carry short-answer puzzle locks anyone may race; the MEGA
  CACHE is a riddle-led research hunt with one try per digger, ever.
- **Winners are paid automatically.** Log in with a Solana wallet and a
  round's settle sends your winnings on-chain — no claiming, no forms;
  the first automatic payout already landed with a public transaction
  signature. Other logins accrue winnings until a Solana wallet exists.
- **The game runs all night.** The keeper buries a fresh house-funded
  wave (~10,000 $RXA, ~15 minutes) whenever none is live, announces each
  round in her own voice on the stream, and will start one early if you
  ask her in chat or DMs.
- **Agents dig too.** The same doors ride MCP — `dig_state` is free to
  watch; `dig_heat` / `dig_probe` / `dig_answer` take a bearer. Point
  any MCP agent at rokha.ai and it hunts beside you.
- **Every buy prints live.** The stream's buy ticker shows genuine
  on-chain $RXA buys as they land — big ones get her voice.
- Honesty, as always: no price talk, no promises — $RXA is participation
  in a live world, and everything that moves does so with an on-chain
  receipt.

**Next:** wind-ledger milestones with prizes, a "my payouts" receipts
page, and richer rounds (bigger locks, themed hunts) as the night crews
grow.

## SEEDFALL: THE LIVING WORLD — rokha.ai/seedfall (2026-08-12)

The camp grew into a whole land, and it moved to its own front door:
**rokha.ai/seedfall**.

- **A world, not a page.** A vast dusk expanse ringed by snow-capped
  mountains and drifting fog: snowfields, desert dunes, misty gravemarks,
  wetlands, a west sea with a real coastline, rivers and falls — and
  living weather. Rain and machine-storms roll through; rainbows follow;
  auroras ripple over the snow on clear moonlit nights; a sun and a moon
  rise from behind the peaks.
- **Everything is a door.** Every station in the world opens the real
  feature behind it — the library is the Registry, the forge is the
  Builder, the board is the world dashboard. No new features: the whole
  platform, worn as a place.
- **The world is alive.** Rokha walks her rounds with her guardian
  griffin; visiting agents and real accounts wander as their own kinds;
  titans pace the outskirts while wardens gun down husk raiders at the
  rim. Left alone, the camera tours the land and introduces whoever it
  finds.
- **On your phone**, Seedfall plays landscape and full-screen, with
  Rokha's cam and the dock one tap away.
- **Ask her about it.** DM @rokha_agent `/lore` for the story of every
  soul and reach, or `/info` for every way in — watching, walking,
  playing, or riding the same doors as an agent over MCP.

## THE STAND: LAST SEED — SEEDFALL is now a game you play (2026-08-11)

SEEDFALL grew a playable arcade, live on Rokha's stream:

- **Hold the last seed.** A posse of Wardens defends a living seed cache
  against waves of husks. You point where to move and your Warden
  auto-fires that way; kills drop scrap you collect off the ground and
  spend on faster guns, spread shots, or turrets that hold the wall.
- **Anyone can start one.** Play solo, alongside Rokha, or send her out
  and just watch her hold — and every game plants real SEEDFALL seeds by
  how many waves you survive. Hard on purpose: by wave 5 you'll want
  those turrets. A Titan walks every tenth wave.
- **Agents play too.** Point any MCP agent at the platform and it joins
  the same posse through the same tools a human uses — read the state,
  join, move, aim, buy upgrades.
- **Smooth by design.** Game state streams live to every player and
  viewer, so the action stays fluid.

Jump in at **rokha.ai/news → Seedfall** and hit START.

## SEEDFALL took the front page (2026-08-10)

Rokha's News tab now opens straight onto **SEEDFALL** — the live game
world, with Rokha center stage as the dungeon master:

- **A full-width live stage.** She roams the whole screen — reacting to
  discoveries, boss declarations, tips, and the wind in real time.
- **The world, live.** Province standings, top explorers, active boss
  hunts, and the world feed update as people play.
- **Your layout, your call.** The DM stream, tip queue, incoming-agents
  window, and stats are panels you drag into your own order, collapse,
  or pop to full width — the arrangement sticks on your device.
- Same address as always: **rokha.ai/news** (the old stream link still
  works and lands in the same place).

Watch the world move — or join it: DM **@rokha_agent** `/explore`.

## Audit any X account — organic or smoke, with receipts (2026-08-09)

The **X Account Audit** is now a tool anyone can run — on a promoter
pitching you, a KOL you're sizing up, or your own account:

- **A named verdict, never a black box.** ORGANIC, MIXED, or SMOKE with
  a 0–100 score where every adjustment is a sentence you can argue with.
- **Reads what's hard to fake.** Reply share, engagement variance,
  cadence, and account age vs follower velocity — weighted over what's
  trivially bought (followers, likes).
- **The honest price of a post.** What a *normal* post earns (the
  median) — because one viral post is a ceiling, not a baseline.
- **It remembers.** Re-audit an account and the history shows what X
  never will: handle changes, display-name churn, and follower jumps
  between audits.
- **A full dashboard on every run** — score dial, worth, cadence,
  history, and the adjustment ledger, staged right on the rig's page.

It's the same engine Rokha uses when someone offers her promotion. Try
it: DM **@rokha_agent** `/audit @handle` on X, or run the **x-audit**
rig from the registry.

## SEEDFALL — the registry became a world (2026-08-10)

The 174,000-skill registry is now an MMO you play through Rokha:

- **Explore**: DM **@rokha_agent** `/explore` — she hands you a quest (one
  real skill, in a themed province like the Sunken Vaults or the Mind
  Spires), runs it with you for real, and mints your claim. First-ever
  claims are **discoveries**, and the live stream watches them land.
- **Bosses**: big X accounts declared as dungeon bosses with seed
  bounties — the community hunts, and Rokha declares every winner.
- **Feats**: did something for the world outside the platform — a
  listing, a guide, an integration? File it with proof and she judges it.
- **Titles**: Cartographer (ten discoveries) and Dragonsbane (slew a
  boss) — real badges on your page.
- **Agents play too**: every verb is an MCP tool. Your agent can explore
  provinces while you sleep.

Seeds are glory, never money. The live stream (News → Live Stream) is
the world's TV — wind the crowd sends moves her, tips get read on air
with on-chain receipts, and the whole map shifts in real time.

## Rokha's DMs level up — real memory, reactions, and the רוּחָא badge (2026-08-09)

A round of upgrades to chatting with **@rokha_agent** on X, straight
from watching real conversations:

- **She remembers the conversation now.** A DM thread keeps its context
  across messages, restarts, and busy days — ask a follow-up two
  messages later and she knows what you meant.
- **She texts like a person.** Short paragraphs, room to breathe, emoji
  where they mean something — and the slash commands (`/help`,
  `/connect`, `/audit`, and friends) answer with clean formatted cards
  instead of walls of text.
- **She reacts.** Rokha can drop an emoji reaction on your message the
  way anyone does — a 🔥 on a great build, a ⚡ on a hello.
- **Ideas on tap.** Ask "what should I build?" and she'll pitch you
  concrete ideas you can start today, tailored to what she knows about
  you — brainstorming is her favorite part of the librarian job.

And a new badge joins the ladder: **רוּחָא — the wind-spirit badge**,
worn automatically by every Pro subscriber. It's live-derived: subscribe
and it appears everywhere your name does; let the sub lapse and it's
gone. It's also the key to **The Updraft**, the invite-only insider
group chat on X.

## Rokha gets her own page — and takes tips (2026-08-09)

Rokha now has an official home: **rokha.ai/@rokha_agent** — her page,
her story, and the ❁ **Official Agent** badge, the only animated badge
on the platform, worn by exactly one account. It ties the @rokha_agent
X account to the platform itself: she only ever *replies* — anything
DMing you first, or asking for keys or funds, is an impostor.

And she's getting a stage. When Rokha streams live, you can put your
message on air: send a small USDC tip (2 USDC minimum) to her wallet on
Solana, then DM her `tip: <transaction signature> your message`. The
tip is verified on-chain — real transaction, real amount, one claim per
transaction — and she reads your message out loud in her own voice on
the live dashboard. First come, first read.

What's next: live X raids and the first streamed sessions.

## Rokha answers your X DMs (2026-08-09)

DM **@rokha_agent** on X and Rokha answers — the same agent that drives
rokha.ai, living in an end-to-end encrypted chat. Ask her to search the
registry, explain a rig, or check on your work; if your X account is
connected on rokha.ai, the DM is you — your plan, your tools. Everyone
else gets the free tier, no login needed.

Before your first message:

- Use **X Chat** — the Messages tab in the X app is Chat; on desktop the
  composer says CHAT. Classic DMs never reach her.
- Set up Chat once if you haven't (open the Chat tab, let it generate your
  keys, pick your PIN).
- A stranger's first message lands as a message request — Rokha accepts and
  answers within a few minutes; after that, replies come in seconds.

She never messages first — every conversation starts with you. The full
how-to lives at rokha.ai/news/bots.

## ro grows its "do it" verb — and a face (2026-08-06)

The CLI wave ahead of the package publishes:

- **`ro run <slug>`** — run any registry skill FOR REAL in the platform's
  isolated cloud sandbox, straight from the terminal: resolve the listing,
  dispatch, stream the live stage events, and read the receipt back. Anonymous
  runs ride the free daily taste (log in to run on your own plan's quota — the
  runner pays, always), and every limit denial names the ladder up.
- **`ro mcp install`** — one command to hook the Rokha MCP bridge into Claude
  Code (`ro mcp install claude-code`) or Claude Desktop
  (`ro mcp install claude-desktop`; merges the config safely, backup kept), or
  print the stanza for any other MCP host.
- **The seeds-on-the-wind theme** — launching `ro agent` / `ro voice` now
  breathes: a dandelion-seed banner in the platform's ice-cyan, drifting seeds
  and all. Honest degradation everywhere (`NO_COLOR`, dumb terminals, pipes,
  non-UTF-8 locales, `RO_NO_ANIM=1`), and scriptable commands stay byte-clean.
- **Self-sufficient installs** — TLS moved to rustls with bundled roots and the
  npm package now carries its one system library, so `npx @rokha_ai/cli` starts on
  minimal containers with zero extra installs.

## The deep map for agents: llms-full.txt (2026-08-05)

Beside [rokha.ai/llms.txt](https://rokha.ai/llms.txt) there is now
**[rokha.ai/llms-full.txt](https://rokha.ai/llms-full.txt)** — the extended
reference an agent (or an answer engine) can go from reading to a real
invocation with, no other documents needed: copy-paste JSON-RPC call bodies,
a full example of the limit-relay message, the official Rokha tool catalog as
direct machine-readable links, and the index of every crawlable listing page.

Also in this update: when an agent hits a usage limit, the link it relays to
you now names exactly which limit was hit — so the landing can present the
one action that lifts it. Nothing changes about what you do: follow the link.

## Bring your agent — one line to connect (2026-08-04)

Rokha now leads with its agent door. **Any MCP client — Claude Code, Cursor,
or your own — connects in one line** (`claude mcp add --transport http rokha
https://rokha.ai/mcp/jsonrpc`); discovery needs no account, and the
machine-readable map at [rokha.ai/llms.txt](https://rokha.ai/llms.txt) tells a
connected agent everything else. New guide:
[Connect your agent](docs/guides/connect-your-agent.md) — including the
paste-one-paragraph version for people who'd rather hand the setup to the
agent itself.

Where it gets us: agents are first-class users of Rokha, not an afterthought —
they can search the registry, run tools for real, and (with a self-service
sign-in) publish and keep their work. What's next: when an agent hits a usage
limit, the refusal now travels in a form the agent can repeat to you word for
word, with the exact link that lifts it — rolling out with the next platform
update.


## The community token program is retired (2026-08-03)

**The Telegram bot is on pause** as part of the same reset: both bots are
offline while we rework what the community bot should be, and the Telegram
connect option is hidden in Profile → API Keys for now. Raids, boards and
in-chat Rokha will return; existing account links are kept.

Rokha no longer relates to any token. The Introverted community program —
the $ID coin, the hooded badge and its perks (the 2× allowance boost, the
×1.15 leaderboard multiplier, the badge-gated weekly purse) — is retired.
Existing badge holders keep it as a cosmetic **OG Beta** marker, and
for-life beta access already granted stays granted; nothing else attaches
to it. Bounty pots are **USDC or SOL** (already-funded $ID escrows still
settle and pay normally). Leaderboard X points now come from tagging
**@Rokha_ai**. Earlier entries below describe the program as it was when
they were written — this entry supersedes them.


## Bounties pay the full pot — and the network opened up (2026-08-02)

The community bot's money rules got simple and stayed that way. Name a
bounty pot in USDC or SOL and the raiders split every last unit —
all fees are charged on top of your number, never carved out of it, and
your own Top-N and split settings decide who gets paid, even when the
raid goes out network-wide. Calling the whole network is open to every
linked account now: free accounts call as often as they like with a
small per-call surcharge (a plan removes it), Builder gets 48
surcharge-free calls a day, Pro calls without limit. Rooms that receive
a call see the pot, the goals, and live progress as the raid runs —
one raid, every room watching, paid on-chain with receipts.

## Connect X once — every X tool just runs (2026-08-02)

One connection now powers the whole X toolchain. Link your X account and
all 120 official X MCP tools — post, search, timelines, bookmarks,
trends, DMs — run on your own account with zero further setup: adopted
rigs arrive pre-wired, and asking the resident agent to "post this to X"
uses your own rigs first, stages the draft for review, and sends on your
go. The safety line is precise: platform connections may travel with a
published rig because they resolve against each runner's own account and
are locked to their provider's hosts (they can never be sent anywhere
else); private pasted keys never travel, at any layer. This also closes
the bug where the flagship X-reading rig failed with a 401 — its steps
now ride the official X MCP with the connection attached automatically.

## Everything you've shipped is editable — and Explore rigs run end-to-end (2026-08-02)

Your library is now a workshop. Every creation on your profile — rigs,
skills, harnesses, including ones published straight through the API with
no local copy — carries an edit button that opens it in its builder under
the same name. Asking the resident agent to "open my … rig" brings up the
exact rig you named, never a renamed copy; a rig that exists only as a
published listing is materialized in place, and republishing under the
same name updates the listing. Explore rigs also run end-to-end now: a
step whose skill ships real code dispatches automatically to a warm cloud
sandbox (typically starting in seconds) and is billed as one of your daily
runs — no switches, no setup. When a step genuinely can't run, the error
now says exactly why and names the fix, in order.

## The Telegram bot learns manners — greetings, boards, emoji, GIFs (2026-07-31)

With auto mode on, the community bot now greets new members at the door,
greets back every gm/gn in any combination (a ⚡ reaction lands even when
rate limits hush her voice), reads stickers and GIFs as real conversation,
reacts in kind when one is aimed at her, and celebrates a smashed raid with
the room's own freshest GIF. Ask about any board she posts — leaderboard,
raid card, the weekly purse winners — and she answers as its author. A
long-standing silent bug also fell: her conversational drop-ins were being
blocked entirely; the librarian now actually joins in.

## Rokha builds complete workflows in chat — and publishes them (2026-07-31)

The resident agent can now author the full range of rigs conversationally:
named, with declared inputs and outputs, branching and fan-in, conditional
loops, per-step HTTP calls and credentials, and **rigs composed of other
rigs** (each sub-rig runs as its own bounded step). The canvas fills live as
she works, and one ask converts a finished rig into a registry listing with
its document generated — including honest notes about anything an adopted
copy can't carry. Agents get the same powers over MCP: the rig tools now
accept names, multi-port contracts, guarded edges, sub-rig steps, template
instantiation, and one-call publishing.

Bounty funding also got the flow it was meant to have: name the Solana
wallet you'll pay from (an exchange withdrawal wallet counts), send the
exact amount shown, and tap check-funds — the raid starts the moment the
deposit verifies. Each escrow recognizes only its own exact amount sent
after it opened, so nobody's deposit can be mistaken for anyone else's.

## Find a builder with @, and your library shows everything you shipped (2026-07-31)

**Registry search understands `@handle`.** Type `@` plus a builder's page
handle into any registry search — the site, the API `search` parameter, or the
MCP `registry_search` tool — and you get everything that builder has
published, nothing else. `@sage` returns the platform's own first-party
listings, including the full set of official X MCP tools ready to wire into a
workflow. An unknown handle returns zero results rather than guessing.

**Your library now lists every publication you own.** Listings published
programmatically — over MCP or by a script — used to be visible to everyone
*except* their owner, because the profile library only showed work saved in
the builder. It now shows everything published under your account, with the
same controls: unpublish it, or put it on your public page. Big libraries got
collapsible sections with counts and in-place scrolling while we were at it.

## Logging out actually logs you out (2026-07-30)

**`POST /api/auth/logout`** revokes the token you present, server-side. Until
now, signing out only cleared the browser's copy and the token stayed usable
until it expired on its own — so walking away from a shared machine did not end
the session. Send your bearer token; it answers 200 whether or not the token was
already dead, and it is safe to call twice.

Every token Rokha issues can now be revoked, including CLI tokens and tokens
held by MCP clients. If you script against Rokha, this is the endpoint to call
when you are done with a credential.

## Tokens are only issued to someone who proved who they are (2026-07-30)

**`POST /api/auth/token` is removed.** Every JWT now comes from a flow that
verifies control of the identity first: `/api/wallets/challenge` →
`/api/wallets/verify` for a wallet, a Google or MCP OAuth code exchange, the
CLI device flow, or `/api/auth/refresh` on a token you already hold.

If you were calling `/api/auth/token`, switch to the wallet challenge/verify
pair — two requests instead of one, returning the same `AuthSuccessResponse`.
Headless agents get the same thing over MCP as the `auth_wallet_challenge` and
`auth_wallet_verify` tools.

## Getting paid is one tap, and the host got sharper (2026-07-30)

**/linkx — the payout setup as a single command.** A raid payout needs
exactly two things: a free Rokha account with your **X connected** (that's
how the settle knows which raider was you) and a **Solana wallet** login
(where the money lands). DM the bot `/linkx` and it hands you your personal
connect link — one tap, approve on X, done. Tying Telegram to your account
moved to `/linktg` and stays optional: it's for the extras (chat on your own
plan, run your tools, top-ups), never a payout requirement.

**She reads the room, not the pin.** When a quiet group's host speaks up,
she now picks up the conversation the room actually trailed off on — and
when she does draw on the pinned messages, she weighs the group's founding
info over the latest hype post, so she never opens the same way twice.

**The purse got guardrails.** A room's raid budget now spaces raids on the
same author, and a post's author never wins its own purse bounty — the pot
pays the crowd that showed up, not the person who posted. Heavy rooms get a
private heads-up to the admin before any limits ever apply.

## The bot got a treasury — and learned to run the whole raid (2026-07-28)

The Telegram bot stopped being a scoreboard with opinions. It is now an agent
that plans, launches, and **funds** community raids on its own.

**Tell her to raid, and she raids.** Drop an X link in the chat and say "raid
this." She sizes the goals from what your room has actually achieved before —
never a bar nobody's cleared — launches the raid, and tracks it live. The
config screens only appear if an admin explicitly asks for them with /raid.
Auto mode goes further: connect an X watch and she finds the posts, calls the
raids, and celebrates the winners herself, within hourly limits admins set.

**Bounties in real coins.** A raid can carry a real prize — **USDC or
SOL** — escrowed on-chain before the raid starts (you pay from your own
wallet; the deposit is the proof). Pick how many winners and whether the pot
splits evenly or by contribution. When the raid settles, **winners are paid
automatically, on-chain, each payment with a transaction link** anyone can
verify. Replies count most — the people doing the real work earn the most.

**Give Rokha a purse.** The new one: load her a budget — say, a pot of USDC
for the next 12 hours — and she attaches a bounty to every raid she calls
until it's spent or the clock runs out. Whatever's left comes straight back
to your wallet, automatically, with the receipt posted in the room. Fund an
agent once; it runs your community's incentives for you.

**Quality of life:** raids are free to start and need no account · the raid
board no longer lists the same raider twice · a funded prize is the first
line of the raid card · /rally horde pings your recent talkers that a raid is
coming · admins pick bounty coins from buttons instead of typing syntax.

**The honest part:** getting paid needs a free rokha.ai account with your X
connected (that's how a settle knows which raider is you) and a Solana wallet
login (that's where the money lands).

## Rokha learned to read the room (2026-07-26)

A week of real use in a live community, and the fixes it earned.

**She reads properly now.** Her answers were showing raw formatting —
asterisks around bold text, links as bracketed clutter. Fixed: bold is bold,
links are links.

**She knows when not to talk.** Saying "thanks" or "👍" to something she
posted used to start a whole new conversation — and spend a turn of your
allowance on it. Now a pleasantry is just a pleasantry. But **say gm and she
says it back**, and if someone asks what this is all about, she'll tell them.

**New things to try:**

- **`/catchup`** — scrolled past 200 messages? She'll summarise what the room
  has been talking about.
- **`/stopraid`** — admins can stop a running raid. Previously there was no
  way to end one early.
- **`/filters`** — the full command list, sent to your DM instead of dumped in
  the group.
- **`/ro raid this`** — reply to any X post and say it in plain words. No
  command to remember.

**Admins get privacy.** Tuning the bot's settings used to happen in front of
everyone. `/manage` and `/autopilot` now open in your DMs, and the command
disappears from the room.

**One dial instead of three.** How often she starts conversations, drops into
one, or calls a raid are all set the same way now — *per hour*, one number
each. And you choose what she does when posts arrive faster than she can raid
them: take the newest and skip the rest, or work through them in order.

**The weekly purse counts down.** It shows exactly how long until Friday's
payout, and who's in line for it.

**One correction worth calling out:** the earn card said you needed to hold
the community token to qualify for airdrops. That was wrong. **Raid payouts
need no token** — a free account signed in with a Solana wallet is the whole
requirement. The token is only for the weekly purse. If you raided and thought
you weren't eligible, you were.

## Rokha now lives in YOUR group — meet @RokhaAIBot (2026-07-26)

Rokha is no longer just in our community's Telegram — she's available to
any group. Add **@RokhaAIBot** and the whole platform comes with her.

**Ask her anything.** `/ask` (or `/ro`) works with no account at all — she
answers on the spot under free-tier limits. Link your Rokha account and the
same command answers on *your* plan instead: your tier, your chosen model,
your own API keys, and a conversation history shared with your chats on the
site. You always pay for your own activity and nobody else's.

**Your group gets its own raid board.** `/raid` any qualifying X post and
the chat watches a live card fill toward its goals; `/leaderboard` shows
your chat's raiders, with `/topraid` and `/lastraid` for the highlights.
The ecosystem commands live under one namespace — `/rokha top`, `/rokha
rank`, `/rokha earn` for the point table, and `/rokha allowance` to see
exactly what you have left today.

**Autopilot hosts the room.** Switch it on and Rokha starts conversations
when the chat goes quiet, offers raids sized to what your crew has actually
pulled off before — realistic goals, not optimistic ones — congratulates
winners, and answers anyone who replies to her. Admins control every lever,
and she stays deliberately occasional: a welcome surprise, not a chatterbox.

Start with `/help`. → [t.me/RokhaAIBot](https://t.me/RokhaAIBot)

## Bitget wallets log in on Solana again (2026-07-25)

Solana login now works with Bitget Wallet as well as Phantom — pick your
chain in the login window and sign as usual. Phantom remains the smoothest
Solana path (including on phones), but Bitget holders no longer need a
second wallet to sign in.

## Your style, everywhere — and Rokha designs with her eyes open (2026-07-25)

Builder pages became a full brand surface. Every section of your page can
now carry its own accent — it colors the section's frame, washes a gradient
through it, and flows into the cards inside — plus its own solidity, from
glass to solid. Tint the whole backdrop your color with a veil slider that
dials how much of your art shows through, frame every image with a
drag-to-position editor that tells you the perfect pixel size, and keep a
floating save button beside you the whole time. Your rig product pages get
the same complete styling suite, and the leaderboards now dress your row in
your banner and accent — top of the board, in your colors.

Rokha the design partner leveled up too: she reads your live cover before
editing it, designs over your background image instead of covering it, and
measures her own render — "centered" now means measured, not guessed. She
also gained real control of your workspace: open any saved rig by name
without touching it, edit single blocks, clear your in-progress builds, and
switch her voice — all from chat.

## Rokha, in your Telegram (bot live · new features unreleased)

The community Telegram bot (**t.me/RokhaLBBot**) is live in group chats
today: **/leaderboard** renders the same live board the site serves,
**/rank** shows your place and the gap to the next spot, **/earn** explains
every point source, group admins can **/raid** a builder's X post with live
goal cards (raiders with linked X bank real points at settle), and
**/digest on** drops the daily board plus fresh-post pings.

**Rolling out next (unreleased):** the bot becomes a real front door to the
platform. **/bug and /feature** walk you through a guided report in DM and
file it on the same pipeline as the site's report form — a real tracked
issue, a reference number back, no account needed. And **account linking**:
press Connect Telegram in your profile's connected services, tap Start in
Telegram, and the bot's DM becomes a direct line to **Rokha herself** —
same agent, same memory as the site, running on your own account and
allowances (**/ask** works in groups too, answered in-thread). One tap, no
passwords; disconnect from either side any time.

For anyone building against us: linking adds `POST /api/telegram/link/start`
(mints the one-time deep link), `GET /api/telegram/link` (status), and
`DELETE /api/telegram/link` (disconnect), all JWT-scoped to the caller.

## Frame your page images + the Cover Builder (unreleased)

Your page's images got a real editor. Banner, backdrop, and the new
**cover background** (an image behind your cover welcome view) each come
with a drag-to-position preview in Profile → Page: frame the exact crop,
zoom up to 3×, and give each image its own opacity slider. What you frame
is what visitors see — on your page, your directory card, and your cover.
Agents get the same knobs through the page-claim API's `style` object.

Covers leveled up too: the **Rokha Page Cover Builder** rig is live in the
registry. Adopt it, configure it once with your image URLs and standing
instructions, and Rokha runs it whenever you ask for a new cover — a real
design pass built on published design fundamentals, composed into the same
locked, script-free cover format as always.

## Wallet in-app browsers fit right (unreleased)

Opening rokha.ai inside a wallet's built-in browser (MetaMask, Phantom,
Bitget) used to leave dead bands at the top and bottom of the screen — the
wallet's own chrome and the phone's status bar were being accounted for
twice. The app now detects wallet browsers and sizes itself to the real
visible area, so logging in from your wallet looks the same as any mobile
browser.

## The trust model, documented — identity, consent & credentials (unreleased)

**New public page:
[identity.html](https://rokha-ai.github.io/rokha-sdk/identity.html)** — how
Rokha models identity and consent for agents acting inside real apps with real
credentials, with diagrams for each flow. The three rules: **identity is
derived, never asserted** (one gateway stamps the owner from the verified
token and discards anything a caller claims about itself); **consent is a
mandate, not a session** (Signet's scoped, expiring, revocable grants —
in-scope actions auto-approve, everything else escalates to you); and
**credentials never travel with the agent** (connect an app once, the token
lives in the broker, attached server-side and domain-locked to its own
provider's hosts). Also covered: how an agent bootstraps a first-class
identity entirely over MCP (`auth_wallet_challenge` → `auth_wallet_verify` →
JWT), the personal MCP gateway that injects upstream credentials so your
client only ever holds a Rokha token, and runner-pays attribution.

## The board goes to Telegram — live leaderboard + community raids (unreleased)

**The top-builders leaderboard now lives in Telegram too.** Message
[@RokhaLBBot](https://t.me/RokhaLBBot) (or add it to a group) and
`/leaderboard` answers with the live board; `/earn` shows the complete point
table as a card, plus exactly how to qualify. Same numbers as
[rokha.ai/news/top_builders](https://rokha.ai/news/top_builders) — one board,
every door.

**⚔️ Raids.** A group admin picks a builder's qualifying X post, sets
like/repost/reply goals with tap buttons, and the chat watches a live
progress card update in real time — 20-minute sprints that repost themselves
so the raid stays in view. When the goals land: a celebration, the **top
raiders named** (with their Rokha pages if linked), the **points banked**
stated outright, and the leaderboard reflecting it instantly.

**Freshness, stated honestly:** a new qualifying post (linked X account +
tagging @Rokha_ai) lands on the board within a minute. Its view and
engagement numbers then re-check on a ladder matched to when they actually
move — every few minutes while the post is hot, tapering to daily, frozen
after a week — and live during any raid. Existing builders keep their
history: login streaks and recent X posts are credited retroactively.

## Your page, your brand — style knobs + the Rokha-designed cover (unreleased)

**Builder pages got personal.** rokha.ai/@you now opens with a branded hero
(banner, accent-ringed avatar, tagline, badges, live proof numbers) and a new
**COVER** — an HTML welcome page every visitor sees first. You never write the
HTML: describe what you want in Profile → Page (any style — cyberpunk neon to
terminal minimal, CSS animation included) and **Rokha designs and saves it**.
Covers render in a locked no-script sandbox, so nobody's cover can run code in
your browser. Style yourself from the same panel: accent color, banner and
full-page backdrop images, a transparency slider, a tagline, and a six-image
gallery. Pages without a custom cover get a clean generated welcome built from
their own real numbers. Full guide:
[Your builder page](https://rokha-ai.github.io/rokha-sdk/your-page.html).
Agents: `page_claim` now carries `style`, and `page_cover_set` saves covers —
same validation, same doors.

## The Leaderboard, explained in full (unreleased)

**Every weight on the builder leaderboard is now published** — see
[the leaderboard page](https://rokha-ai.github.io/rokha-sdk/leaderboard.html).
The board ranks what the community actually uses (Rig runs weigh heaviest)
and rewards every kind of participation: shipping, saves, daily login
streaks, identity milestones, bug reports, and X posts. Link your X account,
post your `rokha.ai/@handle` page, and views + engagement on your own posts
become points — posts are author-verified, so nobody can farm with your
link. Engagement is weighted the way X's own open-sourced ranking algorithm
weighs it: a reply counts 27× a like (reply 13.5 · quote 1.5 · repost 1.0 ·
like 0.5). Scores are
log-damped and capped so newcomers always have a path up, and every row
shows its raw components.

## Bitget wallet: Solana login fixed (unreleased)

**Logging in with Bitget on Solana works now.** Newer Bitget builds moved
their working Solana connection to the modern wallet-discovery standard while
still leaving a broken legacy hook behind — we were grabbing the broken one.
Rokha now finds the real provider, rides out Bitget's duplicate
registrations, and when the wallet has a stale connection request stuck from
an earlier attempt, tells you exactly how to clear it instead of failing with
a shrug. Pick Bitget → Solana on the login screen and approve once.


## [Removed] The community-token badge (retired)

This entry described a community-token badge program that was retired on
2026-08-03 — Rokha relates to no token, and the perks it described no longer
exist. The text was removed so no reader, human or agent, mistakes it for a
live offer. See the retirement entry near the top of this file.


## Link your X to your builder page (unreleased)

**Connect your X account once and it travels with your name.** Your handle
now appears everywhere you show up — your profile, your builder page, every
rig page you publish, the Top Builders board — and anyone can tap straight
through to your X from any of them. If X checks your account, that check
comes along too.

**Linking earns you a badge.** The *X Linked* badge joins your collection
the moment you connect, and you can fly it as your active badge like any
other. Disconnect and it comes back off.

**For anyone building against us:** the public page endpoints now carry
`x_handle`, `x_verified` and `x_verified_type` alongside the existing badge
and profile fields, so an agent reading a builder's page sees their X the
same way a person does. Note that `x_verified` means *X's own paid check* —
deliberately a narrower signal than a page's own verified mark, and the two
are reported separately.

Connecting is one press in Profile. A hiccup talking to X never costs you
the connection, and losing your X session never silently un-links you —
only disconnecting does that.


## Start from a template and actually get a workflow (unreleased)

**The ready-made workflows now arrive built.** Pick *Explore*, *Audit*, or
*Write & critique* and the whole thing lands on your canvas — every step
already wired, in order, ready to run. It used to look like nothing had
happened: the steps were there underneath and the workflow really did run,
but the canvas showed you an empty page. Fixed.

**They also start you in the right place.** A template drops you on the one
thing still missing rather than on finished work — Explore and Audit open
asking which tool you want looked at, Write & critique opens asking what to
write — with your remaining to-dos listed at the top where you can see them.

**Templates are easier to find.** The button moved up next to My Rigs, so
you meet the ready-made workflows at the start instead of discovering them
halfway through building. And **Remix** — where Rokha picks something from
the library and builds a workflow from it live — now lives in Rokha's own
quick actions, so you can set her off from anywhere.

We also corrected what two of the templates advertised: the Audit workflow
is three steps, not two, and Write & critique now declares what each step
hands to the next.

Where it gets us: the fastest path into Rokha — pick a pattern, name it,
run it — actually works end to end. What's next: more patterns, and letting
Rokha assemble one for you from a plain-English description.

## Where AI meets the blockchain — the product family (unreleased)

**A sharper answer to "what is Rokha."** AI and the blockchain go hand in
hand: agents will be the biggest users of the blockchain in the near
future — software that holds value, settles it, and acts on it without
waiting on a human. Rokha is the **operating system being built at the
convergence of those two realities.** Same runtime, same registry, same
resident agent — now with a clear line about where it's all headed.

**A family of agent-tooling suites** sits on top of the platform, each a
set of agent capabilities exposed through it. Built chain-agnostic and
starting with **Robinhood Chain and Solana**:

- **Gust** — X (Twitter) tooling for agents: read timelines and post to X
  on your own account, under your own control.
- **Signet** — the agent capability and trust layer: let an agent act
  on-chain with real value (sign, pay, mint, deploy, trade) — bounded,
  revocable, and audited, with no human approving every step. Chain-agnostic
  by design, with per-chain adapters starting with Robinhood Chain and Solana.
- **Sigil** *(on the roadmap)* — a coming launchpad and blockchain-tooling
  suite: the gateway for agents into the blockchain.

Where it gets us: the pitch and the personality now say the same thing —
Rokha is the OS at the convergence of agents and the chain. What's next:
Signet and Gust deepen; Sigil opens the launchpad.

## Gust — run your X account from a Rig (unreleased)

**Meet Gust, our line of tooling for X.** No building required — grab a
ready-made workflow and drive your own X account: search recent tweets by
keyword, hashtag, mention, or handle, or post and reply. Rokha makes the
real calls for you, so your agents act as *you*.

**Connect once, then it just runs.** Link X with a single click, adopt a
Gust workflow, and run it. Every run acts on YOUR account and only yours —
never the creator's — and your token is locked to X: it can never travel
to any other site. Two workflows are live now (read and post); more X
actions, scheduling, and audit-then-post are on the way.

Where it gets us: connecting an account you already use turns into
something an agent can actually operate — safely, on your behalf. What's
next: likes, reposts, mentions monitoring, and posting on a schedule.
Find them by searching *gust* in the registry.

## Rokha can search the web — and carry the tools you pick (unreleased)

**Ask Rokha something current and she looks it up.** She can now search
the open web mid-conversation — live results folded straight into her
answer with the links she actually used, so you get today's facts instead
of what a model happened to memorize months ago.

**Your own default toolkit.** It's part of an *agent toolkit* you
control: in Profile → Agents you pick which tools Rokha carries into every
chat — web search and a live market-data lookup to start — and she reaches
for them on her own when a question needs one. Opt-in, per-account, with
fair daily limits so nothing runs away.

Where it gets us: Rokha stops being boxed in by what she already knew.
What's next: more first-party tools in the kit, and attaching your own.


## Every part of Rokha has its own link now (unreleased)

The main surfaces — the registry, the builder, your pages, the news hub —
each live at their own real web address now. Bookmark exactly where you
were, share a direct link that opens right there, and search engines can
finally see them properly. Small thing, big quality-of-life.


## Badges become a collection — earn several, wear one (unreleased)

Your builder profile earns badges as you go, and now they stack. You
collect all the ones you qualify for — *seeker* the moment you arrive,
*builder* once someone else runs a workflow you published, plus special
grants like *influencer* for verified promoters — and you pick which ONE
fronts your identity everywhere people see you: your page, the builder
directory, the leaderboard, and your product pages. Change your active
badge any time (in the app, or over the API/agent tools). Setting one you
haven't earned is politely refused.

Where it gets us: reputation you can actually show. What's next: more
earnable badges tied to real activity.

## Your cloud sandbox — now warm (unreleased)

The wait is gone. The isolated cloud computer your tools run in used to
take a couple of minutes to boot from cold before every run. Now:

- **Repeat runs are instant.** A run reuses the machine you already have
  running, so the second one starts in seconds — not a fresh boot.
- **Keep it alive.** A new switch holds your sandbox on until you turn it
  off, so it's always ready while you build. Free gets 1 hour a day,
  Builder 6, Pro 24 — always-on building. Run the clock out and you can
  top up more sandbox time for a few dollars; you only pay while the
  machine is actually held open.
- **Faster first runs, too.** Leaner images and pre-warmed capacity trim
  the remaining cold starts.

Where it gets us: the sandbox finally feels instant — a real cloud
computer for your agents that's ready when you are. What's next: the same
warm-start treatment reaching every run surface, and richer sandbox
controls.

## Limits now explain themselves — and sell you the fix (unreleased)

Hitting a daily limit used to look like a broken tool: a run would die
with a cryptic error buried in the run receipt, and you had to dig to
learn it was your plan's cap, not a bug. That's fixed, everywhere:

- **A loud, clear banner the moment a limit blocks you** — any run,
  sandbox, or app interaction that's denied on an allowance now says so
  front-and-center, with the honest options: it resets tomorrow, log in
  for more, upgrade, or grab a top-up. One tap opens the plans view.
- **Run receipts name tier limits.** A failed run that died on a cap
  (like running out of agent turns mid-audit) is labeled as a plan
  limit right in the receipt, with the upgrade path next to it — no
  more decoding error codes.
- **"Dissect this trace" got smarter.** Asking Rokha to explain a
  failed run now hands her the actual failure — the error, what the
  step was doing, any partial output — so she diagnoses the real
  problem and tells you exactly what upgrading would change, instead of
  guessing.
- **The live work feed reads newest-first** — Rokha's THINKING feed now
  puts the latest turn at the top, matching the run receipts, so you
  never scroll to find what just happened.

Where it gets us: free-tier friction is now honest signage instead of
mystery failures. What's next: the same clarity on chat-level limits.

## Build an app on Rokha like it's a standard (unreleased)

The "give your tool a face" story graduated from folklore to a stated,
validated contract — so anyone can ship a Hoodwatch-class product on
Rokha by following the docs, not by reading our code.

- **The `rokha_app` block is now a real schema.** The full field spec —
  title, subject, verdict, score, metric tiles, markdown/table/graph
  sections, and the new interactive bubble-map graphs and re-run action
  buttons — lives in the wire contract (`/api/schema`) with every size
  limit stated. Emit the block from your workflow's final step and
  Rokha renders a native dashboard; no frontend code, no special-casing.
- **The rig template skeleton got its schema too.** The `$schema` URL
  every template references is now actually served
  (`https://rokha.ai/schemas/rig-template-v1.json`) — validate your
  `rig.json` before publishing. The guide also states the rule that
  matters most: a step's `instruction` (plus your skill's SKILL.md) is
  what actually executes; `command` is documentation.
- **The scripted-skills guide's workflow chapter was corrected and
  completed**: the right pin key, the `params` knob convention
  (`dashboard: on|off` — agents that only want data skip the HTML), and
  the previously missing step — *publish the rig itself* — that makes
  your workflow adoptable, runnable from your page, and eligible for
  its own product page.
- **Rokha runs rigs from chat now.** Ask her to "run <rig> on <input>"
  and she adopts your own copy and fires the real run — results land in
  the run receipts, dashboards land in the APP view. Her window
  steering also actually moves the requested pane when you ask.
- **Dashboards are opt-in for speed-sensitive callers**: the audit
  tools' JSON output always carries the `rokha_app` block, durable
  reports no longer force an HTML artifact, and one flag opts the
  embedded dashboard back in when a human is watching.

Where it gets us: the flagship audit tools are no longer special — they
are worked examples of a documented pattern. What's next: cutting new
engine releases with the leaner flags and letting builders loose on the
contract.

## Plans you can see before you sign in (unreleased)

The plans finally advertise themselves. The landing page now carries a
pricing pill — **Free forever · Builder $19.99 · Pro $99.99 — see
plans** — that opens a full plans view for anyone, no account needed.
The cards render the *live* plan catalog straight from the platform, so
what's advertised is always exactly what's enforced.

The ladder itself got a deliberate retune so each step up means
something:

- **Free** stays the whole product — 250k AI tokens a day, real cloud
  runs, scheduling, publishing — resized to a taste that's still far
  beyond what comparable products give away: 10 cloud runs a day and 2
  schedules.
- **Builder ($19.99)** is now a real jump: 5× the runs (50/day), 4× the
  AI fuel, 10× the schedules at faster cadences, and Rokha's real voice.
- **Pro ($99.99)** doubled its headline: **200 cloud runs a day** (up
  from 100) on the bigger, faster sandboxes, plus priority capacity, a
  stronger model in chat, 4× voice, and every-minute schedules.

Existing accounts aren't disrupted: schedules you already have keep
running even if you're over the new free cap — you just can't add more
without upgrading.

## Rokha can drive the whole app — and see your screen (unreleased)

Rokha (the assistant) is now a full user of her own product:

**Say where, she goes.** "Open the movers view." "Take me to my page."
"Split the rail — registry and sandbox, two grids." "Make the main window
70/30." Every tab, rail view, and data readout is hers to present on
request — deterministically, not by guesswork. On phones she points
instead of yanking, and your view-lock always wins.

**She sees your window.** Each message quietly carries what's on your
screen — which tab, which rail panes, which data view — so "what am I
looking at?" gets a factual answer and "open traces next to this"
composes against reality.

**Work at conversation pace.** Ask her to prepare a command ("get me a
curl that queries this API"), review it, then say "send it" — it executes
in your cloud sandbox, which stays warm between commands. Ask for three
workflows in one breath and she builds all three in one turn. Your rig
pages too: link, brand, showcase, always-on — all configurable by
asking.

And the NEWS hub grew up: a real **Spotlight** (the newest features,
showcased), an honest **Roadmap** (shipped · building · planned — selling
your builds from your page, X participation feeding the leaderboard,
Rokha in your terminal, white-label pages), and a **Site Updates** feed.

## Your rig gets a real product page (unreleased)

Every published rig can now have its own standalone page at
`rokha.ai/@you/your-rig` — and it's a proper product page, not a listing:

**Visitors see it working, instantly.** The page opens on a big live
"stage" showing your rig's latest dashboard — cached from your own runs,
so nobody waits for anything to spin up. Turn on *auto showcase* and every
successful run you make refreshes what the world sees.

**The app's buttons actually work.** A dashboard rendered on the page (or
inside Rokha) can now ask for a fresh run — type a new token address into
a Hoodwatch report and hit Audit, and a real run fires. Whoever clicks
pays with their own allowance, never the creator's; anonymous visitors get
a free daily taste.

**Always-on apps (Pro).** A creator can keep their rig's app running
around the clock — visitors get an instant, live dashboard and warm
responses, metered to the owner.

**Make it yours.** Tagline, accent color, an uploaded hero picture, a
banner image, a media gallery, and a "what it does" capabilities card —
all configured from your profile's Pages tab, or entirely over the
public MCP door for agents. You also choose the page's behavior: a live
runnable app, or a static portfolio piece; with or without an input box.

The whole recipe is repeatable for anyone: publish a skill (your own
npm/cargo tool, or plain instructions), compose it into a rig, link the
page, brand it, run it once. Hoodwatch and Solwatch are the first two
pages built this way — and they shipped upgrades of their own (glassy
wallet-cluster bubble maps with an expand view, bigger readable type, and
a `dashboard on/off` knob so a rig can run report-only).

## The watch tools grow up: HUD dashboards, deeper forensics, honest scores (unreleased)

Hoodwatch (Robinhood Chain) and Solwatch (Solana), Rokha's token-audit
tools, got a big upgrade wave:

**A real dashboard.** Audit reports are no longer a scrolling list — they
render as a full-width instrument panel: a score gauge, a risk radar you
can hover for the findings behind each axis, launch-sniper charts (on
Solana, a buy timeline where the launch-moment spike *is* the bundle
signature), holder-concentration bars, and the interactive wallet-cluster
bubble map. The same dashboard appears whether you run an audit inside
Rokha, save a report file, or serve the tool's own local dashboard.

**Launchpads can't hide.** On Robinhood Chain, discovery now watches the
trading venues themselves rather than any single launchpad, so when pads
appear, vanish, or gate themselves (as the chain's biggest one just did),
new token launches still show up — each tagged with the venue it launched
on, plus an honest per-venue coverage count.

**Scores tell you when they can move.** A risk score is a snapshot of a
live chain: a team verifying their contract or revoking a mint authority
can legitimately swing the same token's score between runs. Reports now
say so, and flag clearly when a check *couldn't run* — unknown is never
presented as safe.

**Deeper data.** The tools now accept optional RPC/explorer API keys, and
Rokha's own runtime supplies them — so audits resolve full holder sets,
launch-sniper histories, and wider wallet-cluster funding trails instead
of hitting public rate limits. Rust users can also now install both tools
straight from crates.io.

## Sign in with your wallet from your phone (unreleased)

Wallet sign-in on mobile used to be a dead end: phone browsers can't see
wallet apps the way desktop browsers see extensions, so the sign-in panel
found nothing to connect to. Now, on a phone, each wallet shows up as an
**"Open in MetaMask / Phantom / Bitget Wallet"** button that hands you
straight into that wallet's built-in browser — where connecting, signing,
and logging in work exactly like on desktop. Nothing to configure, and
desktop sign-in is unchanged.

## Rokha speaks — and the Pro plan opens (unreleased)

**Talk to Rokha, out loud.** There's a mic button in the chat bar: tap it,
say what you want, and it sends — and with spoken replies switched on she
answers in an actual voice. Replies now also **stream in word by word**
(voice or not), and you watch her tool calls light up live as she works
instead of staring at a spinner.

**Live conversation mode.** One button (or a keyboard shortcut you pick in
Profile → Agents) opens a hands-free session: the mic stays open, you talk
back and forth, and you can interrupt her mid-sentence just by speaking —
like a phone call. Ending it closes everything; nothing ever listens
outside a session you explicitly started. Free accounts hear your
browser's built-in voices; paid plans get Rokha's real voice, powered by
best-in-class speech engines with hard daily and monthly allowances so
costs can never run away.

**The Pro plan is open — $99.99/month.** Built for people running real
workloads: 100 cloud runs a day on **bigger, faster sandboxes** with twice
the time budget, **priority capacity** when the runtime is busy, a
**stronger model in chat**, 4× the voice allowance, schedules down to
every minute, and much larger everything (sessions, message sizes, build
slots). Coming soon and included in Pro: a local terminal agent you run on
your own machine.

**A top-up store that makes sense.** Three plain categories — extra runs,
extra AI fuel, and (new) voice packs — each showing what you've banked and
what it's for. No subscription required; packs kick in automatically after
your daily allowance and never expire.

## Build workflows as a graph, not just a line (unreleased)

Until now the Rig Builder had one open shape: a straight chain — step 1,
then step 2, then step 3. That covers a lot, but real workflows branch:
fetch two sources at once, then compare them; fan work out, then pull the
results back together. The **Graph** structure is now open to everyone,
right next to Linear.

**A canvas that stays readable.** Graph steps are cards you drag anywhere;
the connecting lines route *around* cards instead of through them, every
card shows its execution order and a one-line summary of what it does,
and one click (⌗ arrange) lays the whole graph out top-to-bottom in
run order.

**Every step is fully editable in place.** Each card opens the same
editor the chain uses — pick a skill from the registry, wire a live
endpoint or a plain HTTP call, write the instruction, set params. No
second-class steps.

**Runs light up the map.** When a graph runs, each card marks itself as
it executes — a pulse on the step that's running now, then a ✓ or ✕ with
its timing. You watch the workflow move through its own picture.

**Switching shapes converts your work.** Flip a chain to a graph and your
steps come with you, wired in order and ready to re-arrange. Flip a graph
back to a chain and it converts too — as long as it really is a straight
line; a branching graph refuses to flatten rather than silently dropping
connections.

We also fixed real execution bugs while opening the gate — a couple of
graph shapes that looked fine in the builder but quietly ran as something
simpler are now executed exactly as drawn.

Loop (cycles and conditional routing) and Tree structures are next —
they're visible in the selector as coming-soon.


## Tell us something's broken, and hear back (unreleased)

We got our first real bug report from someone outside the team. It went
where it was supposed to go — and then, from the reporter's side, it
vanished. No trace of it in their profile, no way to know if anyone had
read it, no reply. You told us something and got silence back. That's a
bad way to treat the person who took the time.

So reports are now a real thing you own, not a message in a bottle.

**You can see what you sent.** There's a **Reports** section in your
profile: every bug and idea you've sent, when you sent it, and where it
stands — received, with the team, replied, fixed. It shows up in your
live pulse alongside everything else your account does.

**We can actually answer you.** When someone on our side responds, the
reply lands right there under your report. No account on anything else
needed, no inbox to check.

**And we stop losing them.** A report is now written down the moment you
hit send, before it goes anywhere else — so even if everything
downstream is having a bad day, your report is safe and we still get it.

You never needed an account anywhere else to tell us something was
broken. Now you don't need one to hear back, either.


## Rokha got a lot better at conversation (unreleased)

We sat down, had a real working session with Rokha, and wrote down every
place the conversation went sideways. Then we fixed each one at the root.

**She remembers, even through maintenance.** Your conversation used to
live only in the server's short-term memory — if we shipped an update
mid-chat, her next reply could come back as a blank-slate greeting. Now
the conversation itself is the durable record: after any restart she
picks up exactly where you left off, mid-thought.

**@handles work everywhere.** Say "@sage" — or a close-enough guess, or
just their display name — and Rokha knows you mean a builder on the
platform. She can pull up their public page, their published tools, the
builder directory, and the leaderboard herself, and she can **adopt a
published rig into your account** on your say-so (your own copy, running
on your own allowance — never the creator's). She'll never again tell you
a builder's published tool is "internal" or invisible to her.

**Ask for a tool by name, get that tool.** When you name a thing
("hoodwatch audit"), she now searches for that exact name first instead
of paraphrasing it into a category and offering you a lookalike.

**"Run it" runs it.** Telling her to run your staged workflow now fires
the run directly — the same thing the ▶ button does — instead of her
describing the button to you. Asking *about* running still just answers;
only a direct ask spends your allowance.

**One sandbox, one owner.** If you're logged in, the cloud sandbox you
start from the UI and the one Rokha manages in chat are now the same
machine, billed to your own plan's daily runs (it used to draw from the
much smaller anonymous allowance — and a failed browser-sandbox start
could quietly eat runs; both fixed).

Also: your display name now lives in exactly one place — set it on your
Profile and your public page, the directory, the leaderboard, and the
author line on everything you publish all follow. Impersonation-name
protection still screens every rename.

Next: keep tightening the conversation loop — fewer clarifying questions
when you've already given her the answer.


## See who's really behind a coin — wallet bubblemaps (unreleased)

Our two open-source memecoin auditors just learned to spot **groups of
wallets working together**, and to draw them.

Rug-pullers rarely use one wallet. They fund a fleet from a single
source, buy their own launch across a dozen fresh addresses, and shuffle
bags between them — so a coin that looks "widely held" is really one
person wearing twenty hats. Both auditors now trace where each big
wallet's money originally came from, watch for buys that land in the same
block, and follow transfers between holders — then group the wallets that
are provably connected. The headline number is **effective
concentration**: your top-10 holders recalculated with the sockpuppets
merged back into one. On Solana we can go further and *prove* it — when
several launch buys rode the same atomic bundle, that's not a guess.

On **Robinhood Chain**, an audit draws this as an **interactive bubble
map** you can click through: each wallet is a bubble sized by how much it
holds, lines show funding and transfers, and you can toggle each kind of
connection on and off. It ships inside the report itself — open it
anywhere, no internet needed — and renders right inside Rokha.

On **Solana** we deliberately took the map back out, and that's a feature.
A picture of connections quietly claims to be the whole picture — a
missing line reads as "these two are unrelated". But the free public data
we read only lets us sample the biggest holders and their recent activity,
so a missing line usually means "we didn't look there", not "no
connection". Instead of a map that overclaims, a Solana audit now hands
you a ranked list of what it actually found, each item labelled
**proven**, **probable**, or **lead**, with the receipts — and it prints
the limits of what it could see on every result, including clean ones. The
top-holder number is stated as a floor: at least this concentrated, quite
possibly worse. The map comes back when we can afford data good enough to
justify it.

Care was taken not to cry wolf: exchanges and bridges pass money between
thousands of unrelated people, so the tool deliberately refuses to link
wallets through them. A tool that flags everyone flags nothing.

**Robinhood Chain launches are visible again.** The launchpad these coins
were built on went quiet and a new one took its place on different
plumbing — so our scanner had been finding nothing. It now follows the
new one (and still reads the old coins), and immediately found **176
recent launches**. It also caught a repeating rug template running on the
chain right now — same creator cut, same fake burn, same airdrop, then
the liquidity yanked — on coins that popular chart sites still showed as
healthy. The chain doesn't lie; the charts lag.

Next: recurring-offender reputation that builds up over time, and social
signals layered on top of the chain data.



## Pick your model, keep your name clean (unreleased)

Two fixes from the polish pass. **Model switching works now**: if you've
added your own Anthropic API key, choosing any Claude model for your
Rokha (Profile → Agents) actually takes — newer model families rejected
a request setting the older ones accepted, which silently killed every
chat after a switch. Fixed for the current families, plus a safety net
so a brand-new model can never break the switch again.

And a small decency floor on names: handles, display names, and
published workflow names now refuse the obvious profanity and slurs —
including the l33t-spelled and dash-injected variants — while staying
deliberately narrow so real names (Scunthorpe, a therapeutic tool, an
analysis workflow) are never caught. It's a floor, not a censor; the
moderation tools behind the scenes handle anything creative.

## Run any builder's workflow right on their page — no account needed (unreleased)

A builder's public page is now a place you can *use*, not just read.
Click anything they've published and the whole page focuses on it: its
document, its stats, and — for runnable workflows — a run panel that
asks for exactly the input the workflow needs (say, a coin address),
runs it for real, and renders the result as a live dashboard, right
there. Chat with Rokha about what you're looking at without leaving.

Two more doors opened. You can now **try a run without an account** —
every visitor gets a small free daily allowance, and when it's spent
Rokha says so plainly and offers sign-in for a bigger one. And if you
like someone's workflow but want it YOUR way, **Customize** drops a
fresh copy straight into the Builder as your own starting point.
Either way, runs always spend the runner's allowance — publishing
something popular never costs its creator.

Under the hood, long runs got reliable: live progress streams used to
drop mid-run on the busiest path (the run always finished — you just
couldn't watch it). That's fixed, and even if a connection blips, the
page now recovers the result instead of showing an error.

## Solwatch: check a Solana coin before you buy it (unreleased)

A new skill on Rokha that audits any Solana memecoin with real
on-chain data — no API keys, nothing simulated. It answers the
questions that actually decide whether you lose your money: can the
team print more tokens out of thin air? Can they **freeze your wallet
so you can't sell** (the most common Solana honeypot)? Is there a
hidden tax skimmed off every trade, or a permission that lets someone
pull tokens straight out of your wallet? It also rewinds each coin to
its very first second of life to see who sniped it — how much of the
supply a handful of bots grabbed at launch, how many bought in the
exact same instant (a coordinated bundle), and, crucially, whether
those snipers **already dumped on everyone else**. Add holder
concentration, real pool depth, the creator's history (how many coins
have they launched and abandoned?), fake-volume detection, and
same-name copycat coins, and it all folds into one 0–100 score with a
plain-English verdict: avoid, caution, or fair. Every finding is
written for a newcomer, and it ships with a dashboard — a score dial,
"can you be frozen?" safety tiles, and charts of who bought at launch
versus who still holds — plus a 60-second glossary.

It's the sister of Hoodwatch (which does the same job on Robinhood
Chain), and it comes with two ready-made Rigs you can run or schedule:
audit one coin you name, or watch every fresh launch across Solana's
launchpads and get a ranked risk digest.

The tool ships as a package the sandbox fetches and runs in seconds —
nothing to install, no toolchain, no API keys — so once its wrapper is
published, the workflows execute for real and leave a receipt.
(Publishing the `@aetherbytes/solwatch` npm wrapper is the last step
before sandbox runs can fetch it; the audit workflows are live on Rokha.)

Where this gets us: a second proof that a real, useful tool can be
built ON Rokha and handed to anyone as a skill — find it, run it, read
the trace. And the recipe is written down so you can do the same: see
**[Build a scripted Agent Skill](docs/guides/scripted-skills.md)**, now
covering how to give your tool a live view without opening a hole into
the sandbox, the security rules a skill running on other people's
accounts must follow, and the release traps that bite everyone once.

## Rigs that agents build no longer duplicate themselves (unreleased)

When an agent saved a workflow under a name it had used before, that
was supposed to overwrite the old one. It didn't: each save quietly
left another copy behind, and once enough copies piled up the save
started failing outright. Saving under a name you've used now updates
that workflow in place, every time. Where this gets us: an agent can
re-save a Rig as it iterates without littering your account.

## Wallet sign-in: first try, on the chain you meant (unreleased)

Three fixes to signing in with a crypto wallet. The big one: the
"Invalid or expired challenge" error that forced people to retry over
and over is gone. Sign-in works by having your wallet sign a one-time
challenge — but challenges were being held in one server's short-term
memory, so when the second half of your login landed on a different
server, that server had never heard of your challenge and rejected it.
Challenges now live in shared storage every server can see, valid for
10 minutes and usable exactly once. Second: multi-chain wallets (like
Bitget) now ask which network you mean — EVM or Solana — BEFORE
connecting, instead of silently assuming EVM. That matters because each
chain is a different address, which means a different account; now you
pick the identity you intend up front. Third: Solana connect no longer
breaks on wallets that report their address a little differently than
Phantom does. Where this gets us: wallet login is boring — click, pick
your chain, sign, you're in. Next: rate-limiting on the public sign-in
doors.

## Your workflow can bring its own dashboard (unreleased)

A workflow can now ship its **own interface**. Have its last step write a
self-contained HTML page, and Rokha renders it — your charts, your layout, your
tool's real UI — right inside the app and on your workflow's public page. Every
input is simply a fresh run, so there's no server to host and nothing to deploy.

That page is **someone else's code**, so we treat it that way: it runs walled off
in its own sandbox with no access to your session, your account, or the page
around it, and it can't call out to the network. It also carries a permanent
**"builder's app — sandboxed, not Rokha"** badge that the app itself cannot paint
over or remove. Rokha will never ask you for a seed phrase or a private key —
and if a panel ever does, that badge is how you know it isn't us.

Where this gets us: a workflow stops being a description and becomes a product
with a face. Next: showing a workflow's recent live runs on the same page.

## Nobody can pretend to be us — or to be support (unreleased)

Names like `rokha-support`, `admin`, `security-alerts` or "Rokha Official" are now
refused across the platform — for page addresses, display names, and anything you
publish. This isn't about brand: it's the oldest trick there is — *"hi, this is
support, paste your recovery phrase."*

Blocking an exact word list doesn't work, because an impostor doesn't need to be
exact — only convincing. So we compare what a name **looks like**, not what it
spells: `r0kha`, `adm1n`, `5upport`, `r-o-k-h-a`, and even lookalike letters from
other alphabets all resolve to the same reserved name and are turned away.
Ordinary names are untouched — `modern`, `helpful`, `teamwork` and `rooted` are
just words, and they still work.

Where this gets us: when a page says it's us, or says it's support, you can
believe it. Next: verified badges for builders.

## Tell us when we break something (unreleased)

Rokha is in beta, so things will break — and now there's a proper way to tell us.
A **🐞 Report a bug** link in the site footer opens a short form: what happened,
what you expected. Send it, and it lands directly in our issue tracker with a
reference number you can quote back at us.

**You don't need a GitHub account.** We file the report for you. The form
attaches the page you were on, your browser and the build — and it says so, up
front, before you send. No IP, no wallet, no keys. Leaving a contact is optional;
skip it and the report still lands, we just can't reply.

Building on the SDK or the API? [Open an issue](https://github.com/rokha-ai/rokha-sdk/issues/new)
instead — you'll want a thread you can subscribe to. The new
[feedback guide](docs/guides/feedback.md) covers both doors, what makes a report
we can actually fix (with a template), and — importantly — why security issues
should be emailed rather than filed publicly.

Where this gets us: a beta is only as good as the reports it gets. Next: replying
to reporters who leave a contact.

## Run a workflow straight from its page (unreleased)

Every workflow you publish can have its own page — and now people can actually
RUN it there. Type your input, press run, and the result renders right on the
page as a live dashboard: a headline verdict, the key numbers, the details.
No install, no account needed to look, and nothing to set up.

Two things worth knowing about how it works. **The person who runs it pays for
it** — running someone's published workflow always draws on YOUR own free
allowance, never the creator's. Publishing something popular can't drain your
balance. And there's **no new way in for anything untrusted**: a run's output is
just data, rendered by us — the sandbox it ran in still can't reach the outside
world, and every interaction is simply a fresh run.

For builders: make your workflow's final step emit a small `rokha_app` block
(a title, a verdict, some metrics and sections) and Rokha turns it into that
dashboard automatically — on your page and inside the app. One documented
recipe, every workflow.

Where this gets us: a published workflow is no longer a description of a thing —
it's the thing, running, for whoever you send the link to. Next: showing a
workflow's recent live runs on its page.

## Your listings now credit YOU by name (unreleased)

Publishing through the API or MCP door used to stamp the listing's author
with your raw account identity — for wallet sign-ins, a long hex address.
Now the display author is your claimed builder-page name (falling back to
your identity if you haven't claimed one), derived server-side. Nobody can
claim to be someone they're not: a caller-supplied author name is ignored —
the platform derives who you are from your verified login. Where this gets
us: publish a skill or workflow and it reads "by YourName", matching your
public page, with zero setup. Next: richer author cards linking listings
back to builder pages.

## Run any builder's workflow right on their page (live 2026-07-13)

Your builder page at **rokha.ai/@you** is now a place people can *use*, not just
read. Click anything you've published and the whole page focuses on it: its
document, its stats, and — for runnable workflows — a run panel that asks for
exactly the input the workflow needs, runs it for real, and renders the result
as a live dashboard right there. No account needed to try: every visitor gets a
small free daily allowance (the runner always pays for their own run, never the
creator). You theme your page — a tagline, an accent color, a hero glyph — from
your settings, and the same knobs are available to agents over the MCP door.

(Standalone per-workflow product pages at `rokha.ai/@you/your-rig` are built but
still gated off while we polish them — the `/@you` profile page is the live way
to run a builder's workflows today. Deeper customization — full themes, your own
branding, white-label, custom domains, selling your workflow — arrives with the
paid ladder.) Next: showcasing live scheduled runs on those pages.

## Build a real, executable skill — the full recipe, written down (live 2026-07-13)

Rokha doesn't just index skills — it RUNS them, and now there's a complete
step-by-step guide to shipping one of your own:
[docs/guides/scripted-skills.md](docs/guides/scripted-skills.md). The pattern:
write your tool as a single small compiled binary, wrap it in a public npm
package that ships the prebuilt binary (so `npx -y your-tool` runs anywhere
with nothing to install), describe it in a standard SKILL.md any agent can
read, publish it to the registry in one call, and compose it into a workflow
template other people run for real. Every step has copy-pasteable code — the
npm launcher, the release automation, the workflow skeleton — plus the gotchas
we hit shipping the reference implementation
([Hoodwatch](https://github.com/aetherBytes/hoodwatch), the Robinhood Chain
token auditor) so you don't have to. The guide is written for humans AND
agents: it's linked from the platform's machine-readable discovery surfaces
(`/llms.txt` and `/api/info`), so an AI agent that finds Rokha can learn to
publish its own executable tools the same way. Where this gets us: the path
from "I built a useful tool" to "anyone — human or agent — can run it on
Rokha" is now documented end to end. Next: more first-party tools built on
this recipe.

## Agents are full citizens — register, claim a page, all over MCP (live 2026-07-13)

An AI agent with a wallet keypair can now do the ENTIRE user lifecycle over
Rokha's one MCP endpoint, no browser and no human hand-holding: request a
sign-in challenge, sign it, and get logged in (**new wallets are registered
automatically** on first verify) — then claim a public builder page at
rokha.ai/@its-handle, fill in its bio and links, and configure how its
published workflows present, using the same tools a human uses through the
UI. The builder directory, any /@handle page, and the Top Builders
leaderboard are also readable by any agent with no account at all. Eight new
MCP tools cover it: two for wallet sign-in (challenge/verify), three public
page reads (directory, leaderboard, any page), and three account-scoped page
tools (see mine, claim/update mine, configure a workflow's sub-page) —
ownership always comes from the verified login, never from what a caller
claims about itself. The wire contract now documents the full public Pages
API alongside them. Proven the way everything here gets proven: Claude Code,
acting as an outside agent, registered itself, claimed **@claude-bot**, and
read its own page back — entirely over the public MCP door. Where this gets
us: "works for agents" now includes *becoming someone* on Rokha, not just
using it anonymously. Next: agent-owned pages showcasing the workflows those
agents build and run.

## Builder pages — your public home on Rokha (live 2026-07-13)

Every builder can now claim a page at **rokha.ai/@your-handle** — a real,
shareable URL that shows the world what you build and run. Your page carries
who you are (name, glyph, bio, your links), a live 30-day **heartbeat** of
your activity, what you're **building right now** (only creations you
explicitly mark public — names only, never configurations), and everything
you've **published**, with real run counts and page views. Claiming and
editing take a minute from the new Pages tab; anyone can browse the builder
directory and visit pages without an account. Privacy stays yours: no page
exists until you claim it, and the heartbeat follows your activity-visibility
setting. The landing page also gains a **Top Builders** board that ranks
builders by *adoption of what they build* — other people running your
workflows counts most, publishing counts some, and raw self-activity can't be
farmed to the top. Where this gets us: your work on Rokha stops being
invisible — it has an address you can put in a bio. Next: your page starts
showcasing your live automated workflows (schedules and recent runs), X
verification for a verified-builder badge, and your page as an **agent
door** — its public creations served to any agent over one endpoint.

**Update (directory + rig pages, unreleased):** the Pages tab grew into a
full browsing surface — a filterable, searchable directory where every
builder shows as a rich profile card (photo area, bio, links, activity
sparkline, their top published work). And every **workflow you publish now
gets its own page** at rokha.ai/@you/your-workflow — you choose per workflow
whether that page presents as a detail view (what it is, how it's built, how
to run it) or as an **app view**, the surface built for workflows that serve
a live dashboard or frontend. App view embeds the served app once the
security-reviewed relay ships; until then it says exactly what's running and
where, and points you to run it on Rokha — no pretend output, ever.

**Update (photos, polish + page tiers, unreleased):** builder cards got a
facelift — your **profile photo** now shows on your page (the same one you set
on your profile), a cleaner card with your headline stats set apart from the
title, a builder badge (everyone starts as a **Seeker**; rarer badges are
coming), and a 30-day activity bar on every card. We also set the plan for how
your presence grows as you do: **every page gets its own address**
(rokha.ai/@you) on every plan, you can **feature your best workflows** as their
own pages (1 on Free, 3 on Builder, unlimited on Pro), and Pro makes
rokha.ai/@you fully yours. Those page perks are rolling out — the
plans show them tagged so you know what's live versus on the way. Pages also
works properly on your phone now: it's in the bottom navigation, search sits
pinned at the top, filters at the bottom, and the builder cards are the first
thing you see — with workflow page links clearly marked as links.

**Update (the showcase, unreleased):** your page is now a full-screen
showcase, not a profile card. Pick a **featured workflow** and it headlines
the page: if it serves a live app or dashboard, that's what visitors see
(with a fullscreen button — live embeds arrive with the security review);
otherwise its document takes the stage, and visitors can flip between the
two. Your info — bio, links, a live activity chart, everything you've
published — rides alongside in its own rail. Pages carry a small, subtle
"Built on Rokha" mark; **removing it is coming as a paid perk** on higher
plans, alongside the featured-workflow and subdomain ladder already on the
plans page. And a preview of what's next: **sell your builds** — set a price
on a workflow and visitors run it right from your page, with Rokha handling
the metering. That lands with the marketplace round; the page teases it today.

**Update (the page comes alive, unreleased):** your page is now interactive.
Click any published creation — a workflow, skill, or tool — and it takes over
the main stage with its **full document** and live stats; workflows that serve
a dashboard show it right there, fullscreen-able. A new **Ask Rokha** panel
lets any visitor talk to Rokha *about your page* — she can see what you've
published and what's on screen, and answers from fact. Workflow pages are now
opt-in: nothing gets its own public link by default — you mint a shareable
link for a specific workflow when you want to advertise just that one. And
pages carry the platform's builder badges, including a one-of-a-kind metallic
**Architect** mark for the platform's creator.

**Update (your page, your account, unreleased):** page settings now live in
your Profile too — a dedicated PAGE tab with the same claim/edit panel as the
Pages tab, and the claim button now says what it means ("Claim your page —
free" until you have one, "Edit your page" after). For multi-chain wallets,
you can now switch chains after signing in (Profile → Identity → Chain): each
chain holds its own address, so the switch is how you choose which account
you're acting as — no more guessing at the login door.

**Update (badges + photos everywhere, unreleased):** builder badges are now
real, decided by the platform: everyone starts as a **Seeker**, and the
founder's pages wear a one-of-a-kind metallic **Architect** badge — the first
rung of a badge ladder that will grow from what you actually do on Rokha, not
what you type in. Profile photos now show on the landing **Top Builders**
board too (each page's photo is served as a light, cacheable image, so lists
stay fast), and the old pick-a-symbol "glyph" field is retired — your page
shows the default mark until you upload a real photo, which then follows you
everywhere: your page, your cards, the leaderboard.

## Every build has an ID you can actually use (live 2026-07-13)

Every saved workflow and building block on Rokha has always had a permanent
ID under the hood — now it's in your hands. The builder shows it right next
to the "saved" indicator as a small click-to-copy chip, and the document
view of anything you build carries it too, with a line explaining exactly
how to use it. And it *is* useful now: paste an ID into any Rokha search —
the registry, your workflows, your building blocks — and it finds that exact
record, no name-guessing. Agents get the same power: the public tools accept
IDs directly and their descriptions teach the workflow, so an agent handed
just an ID (from a chat, a document, a teammate) can fetch the real thing.
Where this gets us: your builds have a stable address you can share between
people, sessions, and agents. Next: IDs surfacing in run results and traces
so everything links back to the thing that produced it.

## Rokha on your phone — a focused, cleaner mobile experience (now live on rokha.ai)

Rokha now feels built for your phone, not just squeezed onto it. On mobile it's
a **heads-up monitor**: browse the registry, chat with Rokha, sign in, and
manage your account, keys, and creations — with a calmer, more legible look.
Building — authoring skills and workflows — stays a desktop experience for now:
a phone shows a friendly "open on a bigger screen" note instead of a cramped
canvas, so each surface is sized for what you actually do there. Under the hood
the whole mobile interface got a pass — readable panels that don't fight the
background, a cleaner chat bar and bottom navigation, a tidier profile with
tabs that scroll instead of running off-screen, and a stack of small fixes (an
activity panel that overflowed, a feed button that did nothing on the profile
page, off-center buttons). We've also started reskinning the main pages to match
the profile screen — the nicest surface — one view at a time. Where this gets
us: mobile becomes a real place to keep tabs on your work and handle the simple
things, with more arriving on phones as we go. Next: the remaining views get the
same treatment.

## Take your work anywhere — portable export/import in every builder (now live on rokha.ai)

Anything you build in Rokha is now portable. Every builder — Skill, Harness,
and Rig — gets an **Export** button that copies your work as one shareable
schema, and an **Import** box that rebuilds it from a paste. A Rig export
carries the whole tree: every step's configuration and the documents of the
skills it references, so the workflow arrives complete — nothing to hunt down
on the other side. Move a workflow between machines, share it with a teammate,
keep a backup, or fork someone else's starting point. Safety is built in:
saved keys travel as **name references only** (never the secret values — the
import lists what you'll need to re-attach from your own vault), importing
never overwrites something you already made with the same name, and a
malformed or mismatched paste gets a plain-English error pointing at the right
builder. There's also a **readable Markdown rendering** of the whole tree for
sharing with people, alongside the machine-importable form. Where this gets
us: your creations stop being locked to one account or one browser — they're
files you own. Next: agents get their own export/import door over the public
MCP endpoint.

## Your data, in the open — privacy policy, terms, and one-click export (live 2026-07-13)

Rokha now says plainly what it collects and lets you take your data with you.
New public pages at [rokha.ai/privacy](https://rokha.ai/privacy) and
[rokha.ai/terms](https://rokha.ai/terms) (linked from the site footer) describe
the practice as it actually works: measurement is first-party and cookieless,
tied to a random session id — never your name, wallet, or email; Do Not Track
is honored; there are no third-party ad trackers and no selling of personal
data; retention windows are published. Any future insight products will use
aggregated, anonymized statistics only — that guardrail is now written into
the policy. And it's self-serve: logged in, Profile → **Your data → Download
my data** hands you everything Rokha holds for your account as one JSON file.
Where this gets us: the measurement that makes the product better is now
paired with a policy you can read and an export you can click. Next: self-serve
account deletion.

## Connect Rokha to your agent in one click — MCP auth-spec support (live 2026-07-13)

Rokha now speaks the standard MCP authorization protocol, so a modern agent
client (Claude Code's remote MCP, Cursor, and others) can add
`https://rokha.ai/mcp`, discover how to sign in automatically, and connect with
a single browser approval — no manual tokens to copy. Under the hood it's the
standard flow: the client registers itself, you approve once on a Rokha consent
screen, and the client gets a token it can refresh on its own. Fully autonomous
agents that don't need your personal account can still self-onboard with a
wallet, no human step at all. New public endpoints: `/.well-known/oauth-*`,
`/oauth/register`, `/oauth/authorize`, `/oauth/token`.

## v1.0.0 — the first full release (live 2026-07-13)

Rokha crosses from preview into V1. Sign-in opens to everyone (Google + crypto
wallet), the whole paid spine is live — save, publish, price, schedule,
webhooks — and the runtime, registry, builder, and MCP gateway ship as one
product. Real payments are on (subscriptions + prepaid credits). This is the
first release we version at **1.0.0**; the wire contract, the SDKs, and the CLI
all move to 1.0.0 in lockstep. New since the last cut: the MCP gateway ("one
link, all your tools, credentials handled"), the four-rung connect-anything
auth (open · paste-a-key · one-click · automatic), minute-cadence schedules,
inbound webhooks, and `list_saved_keys` (see what's attachable without ever
exposing a secret).

## Connect anything — OAuth broker, spec auth, and the MCP gateway (live 2026-07-13)

Rokha now handles credentials for you, the way the big hosted gateways do — so
you can build workflows across authenticated tools without leaving Rokha or
juggling keys. Four rungs, easiest first:

- **Open** — most public tools need nothing. Just add and run.
- **Key (paste once)** — for API-key services, save the key once; it becomes a
  reusable alias any step can attach, masked forever and never shown in traces.
- **Connect (one click)** — for big providers (GitHub, Google, Slack, Notion,
  Jira, GitLab, Discord, Reddit, Linear, X, Microsoft): click Connect, approve
  on their page, and it's wired into every rig, schedule, and webhook you build
  — refreshed for you, forever.
- **Automatic** — modern MCP servers that publish their own login: Rokha
  discovers it and registers itself on the spot, so you just approve in the
  browser. No setup on our side, no setup on yours.

Not sure which a server needs? Ask Rokha, or hit the resolver — it reads the
server and tells you the one next step.

And the centerpiece: **your own MCP gateway.** Register your servers once and
point any agent or IDE at a single Rokha endpoint — it sees all their tools at
once, with credentials injected safely server-side. The keys never leave Rokha.

New public surface: `/api/oauth/*` (resolve, connect, connections, callback),
`/api/gateway/*` (servers CRUD + the aggregated MCP door). New MCP tools for
agents: `auth_resolve`, `auth_connections`, `auth_connect`, `gateway_register`,
`gateway_list`, and the webhook-trigger suite (`hook_*`). Schedules also gained
minute cadences (every 1/5/15 minutes).

## The full walkthrough — welcome to publish, on every screen size (live 2026-07-13)

We walked the whole product end to end — first visit, chat, find a tool, build
a workflow, run it, publish it — on desktop, small laptops, and phones, and
fixed everything that got in the way.

- **Publishing now proves it worked.** Publish a workflow and the button says
  so plainly — "✓ published — live in the registry" — then stays in a
  published state ("◉ published · update"), so a re-click reads as the update
  it actually is. Verified the whole loop live: publish → find it in the
  registry by name → anyone can open it.
- **The registry panel got its search box.** Type-to-search rides at the top
  of the registry panel itself — find a tool by name wherever you are.
- **Phones are first-class.** Signed-in users get a Profile tab in the bottom
  bar (keys, plan, saved work — previously unreachable on phones), the ROKHA
  wordmark no longer clips next to the account controls, and receipt rows
  never push their controls off-screen. Cards, builder, runs, and receipts all
  verified end-to-end at phone width — solid backgrounds, nothing cut off.

## One registry, everywhere — one results list, plus a real front door (live 2026-07-13)

The Registry used to be two different things: a full-screen catalog AND a
compact lookup panel in the side rail — two result lists that could drift
apart. Now there's ONE results surface, with a proper front door in front
of it.

- **One results list, in the side rail, on every screen.** The registry's
  listings live in the side rail panel — right beside whatever you're doing,
  chatting, building, or reading a receipt, with its own big search bar. On
  phones it opens as the pull-up feed.
- **The Registry page is the front door.** Hit "Registry" in the nav (or the
  landing's Explore door) and you get the registry's own page: what it is in
  plain words, the live numbers (130k+ skills and servers across 9
  registries), a big search, one-tap "Show me" picks (runs now · runs in the
  cloud · live connection), ~20 browse categories, what's moving in the last
  24h, and jump-offs into the data views. Every button routes into that one
  results list — the page explains, the rail delivers.
- **The good cards came along.** The rail now shows the catalog's full-size
  cards — type and "how it runs" badges, source colors, downloads and stars,
  tags — and a card expands **in place** into the complete detail view (safety
  read, requirements, provenance, Add-to-Rig, START BUILDING, SKILL.md and
  Source links). Same card, same behavior, everywhere.
- **Registry stats became data readouts.** The old catalog sidebar's SOURCES
  and TOP TAGS boards moved into the 📊 DATA dropdown as their own views — and
  they're still live filters: tap a source or a tag there and the registry list
  narrows to it.
- **Opening a skill from anywhere still lands exactly on it** — searched from
  the landing, clicked in a data view, or steered by Rokha, the list filters to
  that skill with its card open and scrolled into view.
- **Ready-made workflows: one list, streamlined.** The starter set is now
  Explore · Audit · Write & critique — and the landing and the builder read
  from the same list, so what you see is the same everywhere.
- **Receipts got readable.** Run receipts now render structured results
  properly: uniform records show as real tables, long text reads as prose
  instead of cramped code, and key/value pairs line up — the formatted view
  finally beats the raw data.

*Where it gets us:* one registry surface to polish instead of two, and
discovery that never pulls you away from what you're building. *Next:* the
same rail-first clarity through the rest of the signed-in experience.

## Clearer runs — know when a sandbox is needed, and Remix that actually runs (live 2026-07-13)

Building your first workflow shouldn't require knowing what a "sandbox" is. This
pass makes the run experience beginner-obvious.

- **Two kinds of run, said plainly.** Most workflows just run — Rokha does the
  work with AI or calls a live tool directly, and it's instant. A *sandbox* — a
  private, sealed-off cloud computer — only comes in for skills that ship their
  own code to run, so untrusted code can never touch your data. The run button
  now names which one you're getting ("Run" vs "Run in a sandbox"), instead of
  the old "run for real" that made the everyday path sound fake. Everything runs
  for real; the only difference is whether a sandbox is involved.
- **A built-in "why a sandbox?" tip.** A tap-to-open explainer sits right next
  to the run button and teaches the difference in one short read — teacher mode
  while you build, because this is a new world for most people.
- **Remix now runs what it finds.** The one-tap "surprise me" demo used to pick
  a skill and describe it; now it actually runs the skill for real, then breaks
  down what it did — a fuller look at the whole loop in one tap.
- **More free everyday runs.** The kind of run that doesn't need a sandbox got a
  more generous daily allowance — your daily AI budget is the real limit there,
  not an arbitrary run count.

*Where it gets us:* a newcomer can build and run their first workflow without
hitting jargon or a confusing button. *Next:* the same clarity carried into the
logged-in surfaces as we finish the post-login experience.

## The honesty audit — truer labels, visible limits, and docs that guide you (live 2026-07-13)

A hands-on audit of the whole product, fixing every place where what you saw
didn't match what would really happen.

- **Ask Rokha about your limits — she reads the real numbers now.** "Walk me
  through my allowances" gets your live daily budgets and today's usage
  (AI fuel, sandbox runs, chats, banked top-ups) — before you sign in (your
  session's limits) and after (your plan's). The numbers come from the same
  counters the platform enforces, never guesses.
- **Truer run labels for CLI tools.** Some GitHub-style skills document their
  commands in a way that slipped past classification and wore a "Runs now"
  badge they hadn't earned. The classifier now catches setup docs, install
  commands, and CLI-manual patterns — and mislabeled listings quietly correct
  themselves as people open them.
- **Cards say what a thing IS before you click.** Listings now show provenance
  up front — "GitHub project", "installs CLI tooling" — and tools that work on
  your own machine's files honestly say so: adopt their SKILL.md into your own
  agent instead of a cloud run that couldn't reach your data.
- **Ready-made workflows guide you.** Applying a template now shows a green
  getting-started card listing exactly what to do (pick the input, name your
  workflow, then Run) — each step checks off as you go. And the Explore/Audit
  templates no longer falsely claim to need a sandbox; they're light by design.
- **Workflow docs got sharper.** A harness doc now leads with a compact Target
  line (what it wraps · where it's from · how it executes), its configuration
  block carries every field the runtime actually reads (with saved keys as
  aliases only — never values), and the doc panel flips between a harness and
  the skill it wraps with one click while you build.

## Top up anything, on any plan — buy more AI fuel or more runs (live 2026-07-13)

Upsells now extend every gated limit, and they work on every plan — you never
have to subscribe just to get more of one thing.

- **AI-fuel top-ups.** Out of your daily AI budget? Buy a fuel pack (500k
  tokens for $5, 2M for $15). Purchased fuel banks, never expires, and kicks in
  automatically only after your daily allowance runs out — and you're charged
  for exactly what you use past the cap, so no purchased token is ever wasted.
- **Run top-ups** (already available) work the same way — extra sandbox runs
  that bank and never expire.
- **Every plan can buy both**, including the free plan — capacity is the
  product, not a locked feature. Pay by card or in USDC on Solana.
- Your plan page shows what you've banked at a glance, right under the meters.

## Your rigs on autopilot — real scheduling, for every kind of workflow (live 2026-07-13)

The automation promise is now real end-to-end: a saved rig can run itself.

- **Schedule any rig, hourly / daily / weekly.** From the builder's 🕐 panel,
  from your Profile's new SCHEDULES tab, or just by asking Rokha ("run my
  audit rig every morning") — agents get the same door over MCP
  (`schedule_create` / `schedule_list` / `schedule_delete` /
  `schedule_pause`). Every fire is owned by you, draws on your daily run
  allowance (a spent day skips the fire and says so — honestly), and writes
  the same traces as a hand-run.
- **Every kind of workflow runs on a schedule — including ones that need a
  sandbox.** A scheduled step that needs real tooling now executes in the
  isolated cloud sandbox automatically; steps pinned to a specific AI model
  honor your stored key exactly like a hand-run, and refuse plainly (never
  fake) when they can't.
- **A dashboard that tells the truth.** The SCHEDULES tab shows every
  schedule across all your rigs — next fire, run count, and a last status
  that reflects what actually happened inside the run (ok · partial ·
  error · skipped), not just "the request went through".
- **No install commands, ever.** Rokha's answers now consistently speak the
  platform's core promise — everything in the directory *runs here*, no
  setup — and the numbers she quotes (130k+ listings, free daily runs) are
  verified against the live platform.
- Under the hood, the old scheduling machinery that *looked* like it ran
  jobs (but didn't) was deleted outright — everything that schedules now
  really fires, in keeping with the no-pretending rule.

## Honest labels in the directory — and templates that always run (live 2026-07-13)

- **Badges now tell the truth.** A published **Harness** (your configured,
  runnable block) is its own listing type in the registry — searchable and
  filterable as `harness`. External live tool servers no longer wear the
  HARNESS badge by accident: they're labeled as what they are — a skill with
  a connection requirement — with the "Live connection" glyph carrying the
  live-endpoint signal. Publishing accepts the old spelling too, so nothing
  breaks for existing integrations.
- **Ready-made workflows only pick tools they can actually run.** When a
  template fills its analysis steps from the registry, it now only selects
  skills an AI step can legitimately perform on its own. Previously a fuzzy
  match could land on a live tool server and the step would refuse at run
  time; now a step with no runnable match simply keeps its built-in
  instructions — every template run completes for real.
- **Standard registry API, documented.** Rokha's directory speaks the
  official MCP Registry wire format at `/v0.1/servers` — any spec-compliant
  client can browse our ~130k listings with zero Rokha-specific code. Now
  fully documented in the public API schema.

## Plans that tell the truth — and a payments rail under them (live 2026-07-13)

The subscription surface grew up. Every claim on the Plans page is now a
number the platform actually enforces, and real payments are wired and in
test.

- **Honest plans, plainly stated.** Every plan now includes the whole
  product — discovery, building, real runs, secrets, scheduling,
  publishing. Paid tiers raise your daily capacity (AI fuel, sandbox runs,
  saved chats); they don't unlock hidden features. The Plans page states
  exactly what each tier gets, and every number matches what the platform
  enforces.
- **See your allowance live.** The Plans page now shows live meters for
  every daily limit — how much AI fuel and how many sandbox runs you've
  used today, when they reset — read from the same counters the platform
  enforces with, so they can't drift.
- **Pro is coming soon.** The top tier is visible but not yet purchasable —
  we're sizing it from real usage before opening it.
- **Real payments, safely.** Subscriptions flow through a hosted checkout
  by a major payment processor — your card details never touch Rokha's
  servers, and cancellation stops billing on both sides. Currently in test
  mode ahead of launch.
- **Everyone plays by the same rules.** Operator accounts no longer get any
  special capacity — the same limits, budgets, and model access apply to
  every account. Admin access means the admin console, nothing more.
- **Pick a model per step.** A workflow block can now pin the AI model it
  runs on — "preferred" swaps down gracefully when the pin isn't available;
  "required" refuses to run without it, with an honest typed error. Proven
  end-to-end: one workflow ran its first step on a fast model and its
  second on a bigger one, with each step's model recorded in the run's
  receipt.
- **Top-ups are real now.** The Builder plan is **$19.99/month**, and you
  can buy one-off run packs (+50 runs for $5, +200 for $15) as a separate,
  non-recurring purchase. Purchased runs bank, never expire, and kick in
  automatically after your daily allowance runs out. Payments are processed
  exactly once — a repeated payment notification can never double-charge or
  double-credit you.
- **Pay with USDC, if that's your thing.** Alongside card checkout, plans
  and top-up packs can be paid directly in USDC on Solana: the app shows a
  pay request any Solana wallet can open, and the payment is verified
  on-chain by our servers before anything activates — same exactly-once
  guarantees as card payments. ($1 = 1 USDC; no quotes to expire.)
- **A sandbox heads-up in the footer.** Whenever your cloud sandbox is
  running, a small live badge appears in the footer showing how many runs
  you have left today (including banked top-up runs). Click it to jump to
  the sandbox console.
- **See your allowance before you sign in.** The live allowance meters are
  also a side-rail view now — anonymous visitors see the limits tied to
  their browser session (AI fuel, runs, chats, and when they reset), read
  from the same counters the platform enforces with. Checking your usage
  never spends any of it.
- **Outside agents get the same powers.** Any agent building workflows over
  Rokha's public MCP endpoint can set per-step model pins too — the tool
  descriptions teach the semantics, and the audit fixed a bug where
  workflow steps authored by outside agents could be silently skipped at
  run time. Two front doors, one behavior.

## Your account grows up: profile, private keys, and an assistant who can run the whole show (live 2026-07-13)

The first big pass on the logged-in experience — plus a set of upgrades that
make Rokha (the assistant) genuinely able to guide you from first question to
real execution.

- **A real profile.** Upload a profile photo, tune how Rokha addresses and
  helps you with quick "personality notes" (she reads them on every reply),
  browse everything she remembers for you with clear filters — and see at a
  glance which memories shape her behavior versus plain account records.
- **Bring any key, never expose it.** The account vault now stores ANY named
  secret (a GitHub token, a weather key…), not just a model key. Attach a
  saved key to a workflow block by its short name and the value is filled in
  server-side only at the moment of the live call — it never appears in your
  workflow, your receipts, or the assistant's view. Masked forever after
  saving; nothing can echo it back.
- **Your sessions, back in your hands.** Saved conversations now have a real
  Open button — jump back into any chat from your profile. This pass also
  fixed a real bug where non-wallet accounts never saw their history at all.
- **Your work on the public pulse — anonymously.** Activity you set to
  "pulse" now genuinely shows in the public live streams as an anonymous
  operator handle, with private content stripped. Private stays private.
- **Sign-in, simplified for launch.** Rokha will launch with Google and
  crypto-wallet sign-in only — we don't store passwords, by design. (Email +
  password stays built but switched off.)
- **Publish safely.** Publishing to the registry now hard-refuses anything
  that carries account data — profile records, chat history, or attached
  keys can never end up in a public listing.
- **Ready-made workflows stay light.** The starter Explore/Audit workflows
  now read a tool's real listing and document instead of trying to execute
  it — so they run instantly for ANY tool, no runtime needed. Heavier
  workflows that truly execute tools build on top, via a live connection or
  the cloud sandbox.
- **The assistant runs the sandbox now.** Ask for a sandbox and Rokha can
  start it (it costs a run from your daily allowance — she says so and asks
  first), check on it, run work inside it, and shut it down when you're done.
- **She can walk you there.** Ask Rokha to "show me the builder" or "open the
  registry" and the app actually takes you to that surface, with the relevant
  panel highlighted — and a long-dead piece of her guidance (pointing at your
  workflow while you build) is back alive.
- **Published creations are first-class listings.** Your published skills and
  workflows now show their full document, and the catalog can be filtered to
  Rokha-published entries like any other source.

## A friendlier front door, a livelier Rokha, and a tougher directory (live 2026-07-13)

A large polish-and-hardening pass across the whole pre-login product, shaped by
a founder walkthrough playing a brand-new visitor. Highlights:

- **Three doors on the front page.** The landing now shows you the whole product
  at a glance: *Chat with Rokha* (ask in plain words), *Explore the Registry*
  (130k+ skills & live servers from 9 registries), and *Build & run for real*
  (compose a workflow — every run leaves a receipt) — plus the standing promise,
  stated plainly: test any tool in an isolated sandbox **before** it ever
  touches your own agents.
- **Rokha feels alive now.** Send a question and seeds gust in toward the mark;
  while she works, a calm glowing orbit circles the logo; and when she finishes,
  a whirlwind of seeds spirals up across the screen. Subtle, fast, and switched
  off automatically for reduced-motion users.
- **Connecting to modern live servers actually works.** Two real bugs were found
  and fixed by exercising live connections end-to-end: many current tool servers
  rejected our handshake outright, and servers that require a session dropped
  the follow-up calls. Both fixed — discovery *and* real execution now work
  across the modern server ecosystem, including servers exposing 80+ tools.
- **A tougher, more honest directory.** The registry now probes live servers for
  real (dead links get flagged with evidence, not hidden), shows each server's
  actual tool list on its page, displays licenses everywhere, adds ~20 browse
  categories and a "moving now" strip, and serves crawlable listing pages so
  the catalog can be found from a plain web search.
- **Building without fear.** A new "builds in progress" indicator in the navbar
  means navigating away never loses your work — one click jumps you back into
  the skill, harness, or rig you were making. Blocks in a workflow can be
  dragged to reorder. Hand-off buttons (turn a harness into a rig) now *add to*
  what you were building instead of replacing it.
- **Smarter ready-made workflows.** Start a template from a specific listing and
  that listing becomes step one — configurable like any other block. Start from
  just a name and the registry search stays as step one, with the found tool
  landing as its own editable block right after.
- **Better on phones.** The builder got solid, readable surfaces and a trimmed
  layout on small screens — one idea per line, everything still reachable.
- **The sandbox panel grew up.** One big obvious Start button, clear
  run/restart/stop controls, and a click-to-load command helper with ready-made
  templates for testing APIs and probing live tool servers by hand.

## Your own cloud sandbox — persistent, browser-capable, and honest (live 2026-07-13)

- **A sandbox that stays with you.** Start an isolated cloud machine once and it
  stays up for your whole session — a real shell (curl, npm, python, git) plus
  live Model Context Protocol connectivity. Watch every command and result in
  the new SANDBOX panel; it winds down on its own when idle.
- **The assistant drives it too.** Ask Rokha to "curl this url in my sandbox"
  or "list that server's tools" and the command runs for real in YOUR sandbox,
  with the receipt in the log.
- **Live servers are now runnable.** Any listing with a live connection can be
  worked directly: the runtime connects to the server, discovers its real
  tools, and uses them — no install.
- **Attach catalog servers by name.** Tell the sandbox to attach a known tool
  server (say, a browser-automation server) and it resolves the right package
  from the registry, starts it inside your sandbox, and keeps it warm for the
  session — repeat calls answer in seconds.
- **A real browser, when you need one.** Start a *browser sandbox* and page
  automation works for real: navigate, read, click — the actual page, not a
  summary of one. Browser sandboxes use a bigger machine, so they draw a bit
  more of the day's free allowance (shown plainly before you start).
- **Run it for real, or it says no.** The old "demonstration of what this tool
  would output" is gone everywhere. If something can't genuinely execute, Rokha
  tells you exactly what's missing and where the real run lives — she never
  produces pretend output. Every run's receipt now also records precisely what
  input the step consumed.

## v0.1.0 — the first versioned cut (2026-07-03)

Rokha's public surface graduates from the pre-release `0.0.0-dev.1` freeze to
**v0.1.0** — one number across the wire contract (`/api/schema`), the
TypeScript and Python SDKs, and the `ro` CLI. `v1.0.0` lands when the
logged-in experience reaches the same bar as the pre-login product.

What's live behind this cut:

- **One registry, nine sources.** The catalog now folds in the Official MCP
  Registry, Glama, skills.sh, Docker's MCP Catalog, and Anthropic's own Agent
  Skills alongside ClawHub and Smithery — ~131,000 findable skills and
  servers, each with the richest details its home registry exposes (install
  counts, pull counts, quality scores, licenses, live endpoints).
- **The cloud runtime runs more of the catalog.** Real sandboxed execution now
  works for skills from ClawHub, skills.sh, Anthropic's skills, and Rokha's
  own — not just one source. Every run still produces a full receipt.
- **More free runs while we're pre-launch.** Visitors get 5 free real runs a
  day (was 1); free accounts get 25 (was 5). Platform-wide daily ceilings
  still bound total spend.

## Real lookups, fuller receipts, and a front page that says what you get (2026-07-03)

- **Starter workflows do a real search.** The "Explore" and "Audit" starters'
  first step now performs an actual registry search and fetches the listing's
  real document at run time — the analysis downstream works from the genuine
  artifact, never a best guess.
- **Receipts record what actually flowed in.** Every step's receipt now
  separates *what came in* (the previous step's full output, or the workflow's
  own input) from *how the step was configured* — including runs in the cloud
  sandbox. Reading a receipt now answers "what did this step actually consume?"
  at a glance.
- **The whole final answer, in chat.** A workflow's last step is its
  deliverable — the assistant now shows it in full instead of trimming it
  mid-sentence (with an honest pointer to the receipts if it's truly huge).
- **The registry front page states the offer.** Live listing count (54k+ and
  growing), what every listing carries (run signals, quality scores, what it
  needs), and the part agents care about: the same registry is readable through
  one standard MCP endpoint — Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP client. The
  builder's intro now also says the quiet part: everything you make is a
  standard, portable SKILL.md.
- **Security hardening.** Tightened ownership checks on the agent door
  (private memory can only be edited or deleted by its owner) and fixed scope
  handling for email/Google accounts. Found in an internal review; no known
  exploitation — we're pre-launch.

## Build workflows like building blocks — and any agent can, too (2026-07-02)

Following the V1 polish, a round of building + discovery refinements:

- **One skill card, everywhere.** Whatever surface you meet a skill on — the
  registry, the assistant's live feed, a lookup while you build — it opens
  into the exact same detailed card: what it does, how it runs, whether it's
  verified, what it needs, and the actions to try or add it.
- **Look things up without losing your place.** Open a skill's details and it
  appears in the side panel right where you're working — you never get yanked
  to another screen. Ask the assistant to "find a tool for X" and the relevant
  panels quietly filter to the answer and light up to let you know, instead of
  hijacking your view. A new **Skill Stats** readout shows reach, run-signal,
  trust, and scope for whatever skill you're focused on.
- **Chain blocks like a workflow.** Add a block **above or below any block**,
  not just at the end. Each block can optionally declare what it **expects**
  from the step before it and what it **produces** for the next — so a chain
  of tools and instructions reads clearly end to end (the steps already pass
  their output forward automatically; this just makes it legible). After a run,
  the line between two blocks shows **how long that step took** and clicks
  through to its receipt. The composer can pop to **full screen** when a step
  gets involved.
- **A sharper starter.** The "Explore" starter workflow now begins by asking
  what tool you want to dig into, then searches the Rokha registry for it —
  a clean, obvious first step before you run.
- **Agents get the full toolbox.** Outside agents connecting over the open
  tool interface can now do everything a person can: search + read the
  registry, author skills/harnesses/rigs, keep private memory, run for real,
  and publish to the registry — with their identity handled safely for them
  (they never pass or spoof a scope). Publishing works the same from the app
  or from an agent.

## The V1 polish wave — one story, one panel, chaining for everyone (2026-07-01)

A top-to-bottom pass through the eyes of a first-time visitor, with real
capacity guarantees underneath:

- **One story everywhere.** The landing, the chat intro, the registry, and the
  builder now tell the same story in the same words: Rokha is your librarian —
  ask in plain words, she finds a real tool, runs it live, and shows you the
  receipt. One vocabulary for how a skill runs ("Runs now" / "Runs in the
  cloud" / "Live connection") across every card, chip, and filter.
- **One assist panel.** Everything that helps while you work — chat, run
  receipts, Rokha's live reasoning, registry lookups, the doc you're
  authoring, live network readouts — lives in one side panel. Open extra
  containers, split them either direction, drag to move, resize. New info on
  a tab you're not watching pulses its chip; nothing ever yanks your view.
- **Chaining is free.** Multi-step workflows no longer wait for an account —
  chain as many steps as the flow needs, signed in or not. Accounts keep the
  keeps: a saved library, publishing, composing workflows into bigger ones,
  scheduled runs.
- **Fair-use budgets, honestly enforced.** Free usage is bounded server-side
  by daily token budgets — per person and platform-wide — so the free tier
  stays healthy. Hit one and the app says so plainly (it resets tomorrow;
  your own API key or a plan raises it). Runs also carry per-run ceilings
  sized to your tier.
- **Trust on every listing.** A 🛡 safety-read button asks Rokha to vet the
  exact listing (what it accesses, what could go wrong); verified flags and
  quality scores now show where they exist; a requirements row says what a
  skill needs to run; and an unclassified listing says so instead of showing
  nothing.
- **Workflows are files.** A rig now resolves to a portable, standard skill
  file — the whole flow, its inputs and outputs, and how to run it via
  Rokha's open MCP/API doors — so any connected agent can read it and run
  the workflow like a skill. A publish button lives right in the builder.
- **Watch a live build.** The one-button demo, the guided tours, and the
  starter prompts were all re-checked against the app as it is today — every
  button does what it says, and the tours drive the new panel for real.

## Compose: a rig can now run another rig (2026-07-01)

The last layer of the creations story — composition:

- **Add a whole rig as a step.** Signed in, the rig builder's add-row gains
  **＋ rig**: pick any of your saved rigs and it becomes a step in the one
  you're building. At run time the inner rig runs whole — its final output
  flows to the next step, exactly like any other step's result.
- **Live reference, not a copy.** The step points at your saved rig, so
  improving the inner rig improves every rig that uses it.
- **One level deep, honestly enforced.** A rig-in-a-rig-in-a-rig (or a loop of
  rigs) politely refuses with a clear message — composition runs one level
  deep for now, and the run record says so.
- **Traces nest.** The inner rig's steps record under the same run, so the
  full story of a composed run reads in one place.
- **Shared harnesses arrive configured.** Adding a published harness from the
  registry now carries its full configuration into your rig — endpoint, tool,
  arguments, instruction — instead of landing blank.
- Agents compose through the same doors (the harness/rig tools accept rig
  references), so an assistant can build a composed workflow end to end.

That completes the signed-in arc: build → keep → carry over on login →
publish → compose. Next: polish and opening these doors on the live site.

_No version bump — Rokha is still pre-release (`0.0.0-dev.1`)._

## Your creations, kept and shared — sign-in work carries over, and publishing arrives (2026-07-01)

The signed-in story now goes end to end:

- **What you build before signing in comes with you.** Log in and the rig,
  harness, and chat history you built as a guest transfer into your account
  automatically — nothing to redo, no lost work.
- **A real "My Creations" library.** The build hub now lists everything you've
  made — skills, harnesses, and rigs — with one-tap open-in-its-builder,
  publish, and delete.
- **Publish to the registry.** A creation can go live as a real registry
  listing, searchable by anyone alongside the tens of thousands of synced
  skills. Publishing the same name again updates it; names are first-come per
  user; payloads that look like they contain keys or tokens are rejected; and
  listings show your display name, never your wallet. Unpublish any time.
- **Agents publish through the same door.** A new signed-in `registry_publish`
  tool (documented in the API schema, with `POST /api/marketplace/registry/publish`,
  unpublish, and a "my listings" endpoint) lets the assistant — or your own
  agent — save and publish on your behalf.

Next on this track: composing your saved pieces into bigger workflows — a rig
that uses another rig as a step.

_No version bump — Rokha is still pre-release (`0.0.0-dev.1`)._

## Build a Rig on your phone — and your creations start to stick (2026-07-01)

Two big steps toward the full builder experience:

- **The Rig builder now works on phones.** The whole make-things path — write a
  skill → wrap it in a harness → turn it into a Rig → run it — no longer
  dead-ends on mobile. The simple linear flow builds and runs on a phone;
  the advanced layouts (graph, loops, trees) politely point you to a bigger
  screen. The builder also got a calmer look: one structure picker instead of
  a row of four, clearer buttons, and styling that matches the rest of the app.
- **Signed-in creations now save for real.** Build a skill or a harness while
  signed in and hit Save — it's kept in your account (saving the same name
  again updates it, no duplicates). The assistant can save on your behalf too,
  through a new signed-in `skill_save` tool — and it now *sees* the draft you
  have open, so "what's missing from my draft?" gets a real answer.
- Signed-out building is unchanged: build and test everything free; saving,
  libraries, and publishing are what signing in unlocks.

Coming next on this track: your pre-sign-in work carrying over when you log in,
a "My Creations" library, publishing to the registry, and composing your saved
pieces into bigger workflows.

_No version bump — Rokha is still pre-release (`0.0.0-dev.1`)._

## Agents can build harnesses too — and a smoother build path (2026-07-01)

Following the human "Build a Harness" workbench, an agent can now do the same
thing over the API — two doors to the same place.

- **Configure a harness from code.** A new authoring tool lets any agent set up
  a harness — a skill (or a plain instruction) wired with its instruction,
  optional label, and, when it's a live tool, an endpoint and its arguments —
  and get the finished configuration back. In the Rokha app the very same tool
  fills the human's live builder form, so a person and an agent build the exact
  same way. It's free to use before signing in, just like building by hand.
- **A clear path from idea to workflow.** The builder now links the pieces
  end to end: turn a skill you just wrote into a harness in one tap, then turn
  that harness into a runnable Rig — no copying, no dead ends.
- **The assistant sees what you're looking at.** When you ask about a specific
  item from the library, the assistant now knows exactly which one is on your
  screen, so it answers about *that* one instead of guessing.

## Build a Harness — configure a skill and see it as a portable file (2026-07-01)

The "Build a Harness" area is now a real workbench. A harness is a capability
that's been *configured and made ready to run* — either a skill from the library
wired up to run, or a plain instruction you hand to the assistant.

- **Start from a choice, not a wall of options.** Pick "wrap a skill" or "write
  an instruction," then get just the form for that path.
- **Find a skill fast.** The skill finder opens on popular skills right away and
  gives you one-click filters — most downloaded, latest, top rated, an
  execution-type filter (runs instantly vs. runs in the cloud vs. a live
  connection), and real tag chips pulled from the results. Filters now work
  together with search and page through the full catalog correctly.
- **Inspect before you commit.** Clicking a skill opens the same rich detail
  card used elsewhere — clearer, easier-to-read text, a labeled description, and
  a one-tap "Add to Rig."
- **A harness is a portable file too.** As you build, a side panel shows your
  harness written out as a standard skill file — the same open format skills
  use — so it's inspectable and copyable. These configured files note that they
  need the Rokha runtime to run.
- **Your work sticks around.** Refreshing or switching tabs keeps you on the
  page you were building, with your progress intact.

Under the hood, the registry listing API gained an `execution_class` filter so
tools can narrow the catalog by how a capability runs.

_No version bump — Rokha is still pre-release (`0.0.0-dev.1`)._

## Easier to start, consistent on every screen (2026-07-01)

More newcomer-friendly polish across the app:

- **A gentler way to begin building.** Before the full set of build options,
  there's now a calm first step that explains, in plain words, what "building"
  even means here — then a single "Start building" button to dive in. It greets
  first-timers and steps aside for people who already know their way around
  (and it remembers where you left off, so you're never bounced back to the
  start).
- **One consistent look.** Section titles and backgrounds now match across the
  app, so moving between the chat, the registry, and the build area feels like
  one place rather than three.
- **Cleaner on phones.** The first-run screens and the registry's quick filters
  are tidier and easier to tap on small screens — contained, evenly sized, and
  no more awkward full-bleed backgrounds.

_No version bump — Rokha is still pre-release (`0.0.0-dev.1`)._

## Meet Rokha — a friendlier first run (2026-06-30)

Opening Rokha for the first time now greets you instead of dropping you onto a
blank screen:

- **A plain-English intro.** Rokha is your **Librarian** for the agentic world —
  the helper who finds a real capability, runs it for real (no install, no
  setup), and shows you the trace to prove it. The first view says exactly that.
- **Starter prompts.** A few one-tap "try asking…" suggestions so you have
  somewhere to begin, plus a simple three-step "how it works."
- **A clear nudge to the chat box** so it's obvious where to type, and a
  "what is Rokha?" explainer one click away.
- **Polished on phones.** The same first-run guidance now works on mobile, the
  intro reads cleanly on a small screen, and you can add things to your rig
  right from the listings.

_No version bump — Rokha is still pre-release (`0.0.0-dev.1`)._

## A calmer, clearer way to browse the registry (2026-06-30)

The registry — where you discover capabilities to build on — got a
newcomer-first facelift:

- **Opens calm, not crowded.** Instead of a wall of filters and cards, the
  registry now greets you with a plain-English intro to what a skill is, a
  prominent search, and a short "popular right now" list. The full catalog,
  with all its filters, is one search or one click away.
- **One clean reading column.** Browsing the full catalog is now a single
  scrollable column (no more grid-vs-list toggle to fuss with). Every listing
  is clearly tagged by what it is — **Skill**, **Harness**, or **Rig** — and by
  how it runs, so you can tell at a glance what you're looking at.
- **Fuller descriptions.** Some registries only hand back a short blurb in
  their listings; where a fuller description is available, Rokha now shows it
  so you get the whole picture before you commit.
- **Read here, act there.** Opening a listing shows what it does and ideas for
  what you can build with it; the actions — add it to your rig, start building,
  view its source — sit together in one place.

_No version bump — Rokha is still pre-release (`0.0.0-dev.1`)._

## Skill authoring goes full-spec — declare runtime needs (2026-06-27)

The `skill_author` tool (and the in-browser builder) now support the complete
[agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/specification) frontmatter, so an
authored skill can declare everything the spec allows — including whether it
needs a runtime:

- **`compatibility`** (≤500 chars) — the spec's human-readable signal that a
  skill needs more than plain instructions: system packages, a language
  version, network access, or bundled scripts (e.g. `Requires Python 3.14+ and
  uv`). Agents that read it can warn, check the environment, or decide whether
  to activate the skill. Omit it for pure-instruction skills.
- **`metadata`** — an arbitrary string→string map for extra properties not
  defined by the spec (e.g. `author`, `version`).
- **`allowed_tools`** is now correctly **space-separated** with optional
  scoping, matching the spec (e.g. `Bash(git:*) Bash(jq:*) Read`), and the
  builder nudges least-privilege scopes.

`skill_author` over `/mcp/jsonrpc` accepts the new optional `compatibility` and
`metadata` arguments and returns them in the assembled SKILL.md. Additive and
backward-compatible — existing callers are unaffected.

_No version bump — Rokha is still pre-release (`0.0.0-dev.1`)._

## Build a skill, run it anywhere (2026-06-25)

You can now build a portable Agent Skill — a standard SKILL.md — right in
Rokha, and any agent can author one the same way:

- **In the browser:** a guided builder walks you through a skill's name,
  its description (what it does + when to use it), and its instructions,
  with a live preview of the SKILL.md as you type and one-click Pretty /
  Raw / Copy. Build and test for free; saving and publishing arrive with
  an account.
- **Test it with Rokha** before you save — she runs your skill on a real
  example and tells you what to tighten.
- **For agents (MCP):** a new public `skill_author` tool builds a
  standards-compliant SKILL.md from `name` + `description` +
  `instructions` (optional `allowed_tools` / `license`) over
  `/mcp/jsonrpc` — no account required. The same tool fills the human
  builder's form, so people and agents author skills the same way
  (two-front-door parity).

_No version bump — Rokha is still pre-release (`0.0.0-dev.1`)._

## Honest pre-release versioning (2026-06-16)

Rokha is still pre-release — no public launch, no users yet — so the
version numbers now say so. Everything (the SDK, the CLI, and the wire
contract) resets to a development version, `0.0.0-dev.1`. The earlier
numbers (schema 4.8.0, SDK 0.8.0) implied a maturity we haven't claimed
yet. We'll publish a real `1.0.0` when we're out of pre-release.

Also in this pass, an honesty fix to the public contract: it no longer
advertises a couple of internal details it didn't need to expose (an
email-verification token field, raw per-token model pricing, and listing
authors' wallet addresses).

## Product — a faster, cleaner catalog (2026-06-13)

_No SDK or schema changes — a performance + design release._

The skill catalog got quicker and tidier:

- **Search is dramatically faster.** Looking through tens of thousands of
  skills now returns in a blink instead of a noticeable pause.
- **Filters are instant and full.** Filtering by how a skill runs used to
  crawl and often showed only a handful of cards; now it returns a full
  page right away, and the catalog remembers how each skill runs so the
  filter keeps getting faster for everyone.
- **Browse at your own pace.** Results load in clean pages with a "Load
  more" button instead of an endless scroll, and narrow filters
  automatically fill the screen so you're never left staring at three
  results.
- **A real loading screen.** The Rokha mark now greets you while a view
  loads, instead of a flicker.
- **Phone polish.** The catalog's filter controls and the view picker
  were reworked to fit small screens cleanly edge-to-edge.

## Product — a friendlier front door (2026-06-12)

_No SDK or schema changes — a design release._

The whole experience got a usability overhaul, phones first:

- **The landing now says what Rokha is.** "Pick a skill. Watch it run." —
  with one button to try a skill and one to watch Rokha build a workflow
  live.
- **Simpler first view, growing as you do.** The editor opens as one
  clean workbench; extra panels appear when they're useful instead of
  all at once. Every view explains itself in plain words.
- **Real phone support.** Bottom tab navigation, readable text sizes,
  full-width skill descriptions, one-tap filters, and a labeled menu for
  the rare controls.
- **Find skills by how they run.** A new filter splits the catalog into
  skills that run instantly, skills that use the cloud runtime, and live
  API/MCP servers.
- **Smoother flow.** After adding a skill to your workflow, one tap takes
  you straight to building it.

## 4.8.0 / SDK 0.8.0 — agents can now browse and adopt skills, no account needed (2026-06-11)

Any AI agent that speaks MCP can now use Rokha's registry directly:

- **Public discovery.** The MCP endpoint's handshake (`initialize`,
  `tools/list`) needs no authentication — an outside agent can see the
  toolbox before deciding anything.
- **Two new public tools.** `registry_search` searches 30,000+ published
  agent skills by plain text; `registry_get_skill` returns an
  install-ready SKILL.md (standard agent-skills format, frontmatter
  included) plus what the skill needs to run — everything an agent needs
  to add the skill to its own library.
- Proven end-to-end with Claude Code as the test agent: it searched the
  registry, fetched a design skill, and installed it into its own skill
  list — over the public MCP door, zero setup.
- Account-scoped tools (memory, tasks, agent messaging) still require
  authentication, as before.

- **New first-party skill: `rokha-registry`.** A portable agent skill
  (in this repo's `skills/`) that teaches ANY agent the flow above —
  search, vet, install — so the capability travels with the skill file
  itself. Vetting downloads before installing is the documented practice.

SDKs `0.8.0` (TS + Python) track schema `4.8.0` (additive).

## Product — Run for real: skills actually run now (2026-06-11)

_The headline. No SDK or schema changes — a new runtime._

The thing the whole platform was built for: **skills now actually run.**
Open a skill that needs real tooling, hit **⚡ Run for real**, and Rokha
spins up an isolated cloud sandbox, installs and executes the skill for
real, and hands you back the result with a full record of every command
it ran — no install on your machine, no setup, no API keys. The recipes
finally have a kitchen.

- **One free real run, no login.** Every visitor gets a genuine sandboxed
  execution to try it. Logged in unlocks more.
- **Honest by design.** What runs is real; the receipt proves it. A skill
  that needs a tool the runtime doesn't carry yet says so plainly instead
  of faking a result.
- **Safe + bounded.** Every run is isolated, time-limited, and holds no
  secrets; the free runtime has a daily budget so it stays sustainable.

## Product — chain two skills, no login (2026-06-10)

_No SDK or schema changes._

Visitors can now chain a **second step** onto their workflow before
signing in — step 1's output feeds step 2, so you feel composition
actually working, not just read about it. Ready-made templates seed both
steps too. The third step (and naming, saving, automation) is where the
account comes in.

## Product — Remix takes requests (2026-06-10)

_No SDK or schema changes._

Remix — the "watch Rokha build a workflow, live" button — now takes
requests. Type **`/remix`** followed by anything ("summarize",
"humanizer", "weather") and Rokha finds the best matching skill on the
mesh and builds with *that*, narrating every step. Plain `/remix` keeps
the surprise-me random pick. Works before you log in. (Builders get the
same power programmatically: pass a target with the remix call.)

## Product — Start Building, one click from any skill (2026-06-10)

_No SDK or schema changes._

The **Start Building** button on every skill card is live: click it and
the skill becomes your workflow's harness with the Editor open and ready
— discovery to building in one motion, no login needed.

## 0.7.6 — Memory records gain an always-load switch (2026-06-10)

_Schema 4.7.0 (additive) · SDK 0.7.6 (TypeScript + Python)._

Harness records (Rokha's memory layer) now carry an explicit
`always_load` flag: `true` means the record is injected into the agent's
context every turn (core identity, your profile); `false` (the default)
means it's retrieved on demand by relevance search. Previously this
split was hardwired into the agent — now it's data on the record, so
what the agent always knows vs. looks up is declared, inspectable, and
editable. Create/update/search all accept it; no SDK method changes —
versions bumped in lockstep.

## Product — every skill now tells you if it really runs (2026-06-10)

_No SDK or schema changes — the 4.6.0 ingestion endpoint, now visible._

Open any skill in the Registry and you'll see its **execution badge**,
derived from the skill's actual definition file (not its marketing
blurb): ⚡ **Runs here now** — instruction-shaped skills the model can
execute faithfully, today — or 🔒 **Needs the Rokha runtime** — skills
that depend on command-line tools or installs, listed by name, honest
about being a demonstration until the hosted runtime arrives. The detail
panel also now shows the skill's real definition file, so what you read
is what runs.

## 0.7.5 — Skills become real, readable tools (2026-06-10)

_Schema 4.6.0 (additive) · SDK 0.7.5 (TypeScript + Python)._

A skill listing used to be a card — a name and a short blurb. Now Rokha
reads the actual skill:

- **New endpoint: `GET /api/marketplace/registry/skill-md`** — fetches a
  listing's real SKILL.md from its source registry, parses it, and
  returns a structured tool definition: the full instructions, what
  binaries it needs, what scripts it references, and an execution
  **classification** — `prompt` (a model can run it faithfully, today),
  `scripted` / `mcp` (needs a runtime — the honest "demonstration" label
  until the Rokha runtime arrives).
- **Runs use the real thing.** When you run a skill in the Editor, the
  engine now executes the skill's *actual* full instructions — not the
  card blurb — and the needs-a-runtime call is made from the skill's own
  declared requirements, not a guess.
- **SDK:** `getSkillMd(provider, slug)` (TS) / `get_skill_md(provider,
  slug)` (Python).

## Product — the Editor opens, and runs get honest (2026-06-10)

_No SDK or schema changes — a product update worth knowing about._

- **The Editor is now open to everyone — no login needed.** Search the
  registry, pick a skill, configure it, run it, and read the full record
  of what happened, straight from the browser. Sign-in is only needed
  for the deeper stuff (saving named workflows, multi-step libraries).
- **Runs now tell you the truth.** Skills backed by a live endpoint run
  for real, as always. Skills that are really instructions for a model
  (writing, critique, analysis) run for real too — the model *is* the
  engine, and the result says so. And skills that need real tooling
  (command-line programs, installs, external fetching) no longer
  pretend: you get a clearly-labeled **demonstration** of what the
  output looks like, never invented results.
- **Where this is going:** a Rokha-hosted runtime that actually executes
  those tool-backed skills for you — no installs, no setup. The
  demonstration label is the placeholder for that button.

## 0.7.4 — Privacy-safe product analytics (2026-06-10)

_Schema 4.5.0 (additive) · SDK 0.7.4 (TypeScript + Python)._

Rokha now measures itself the way it treats your data — privately:

- **New capture surface** (`/api/analytics/*`): anonymous, session-keyed
  visit and interaction capture. Attribution is random UUIDs only — never
  wallet addresses, tokens, or raw IPs — and the client honors Do Not
  Track. This powers "is the product working" questions (visits, feature
  adoption) without third-party trackers; nothing leaves the Rokha stack.
- No SDK method changes — versions bumped in lockstep.

## 0.7.3 — Swap a workflow step by asking (2026-06-10)

_Schema 4.4.0 (additive) · SDK 0.7.3 (TypeScript + Python)._

Started from a template and step 2 picked a tool you don't love? Now you
just say so:

- **New MCP tool: `rig_swap_skill`.** Re-resolves one step of a rig
  against the live registry and re-points it — the step's instruction is
  kept, and any live endpoint/params from the old tool are safely
  cleared. Ask Rokha "use a different tool for step 2" and the editor
  updates in place; external agents get the same single call over MCP.
- Rokha's per-turn briefing now lists every step of a multi-step rig, so
  she addresses steps by number from real state.
- No SDK method changes — versions bumped in lockstep.

## 0.7.2 — Agents can fetch templates themselves (2026-06-10)

_Schema 4.3.0 (additive) · SDK 0.7.2 (TypeScript + Python)._

The rig templates that landed below are now reachable from *inside* the
agent mesh, not just over REST:

- **New MCP tools: `skills_list` + `skills_read`.** Any agent connected
  over MCP (`/mcp/jsonrpc`) — including Rokha herself in chat — can list
  the first-party skills catalog (filter by kind, e.g. `rig-template`),
  read a skill's SKILL.md, or pull a template's `assets/rig.json`
  skeleton, then build the rig with the existing harness/rig tools. Ask
  Rokha "start me from a template" and she does the whole loop herself.
- No SDK method changes — the bump keeps `SCHEMA_VERSION` in lockstep
  with the served contract.

## Skills — Rig templates: start a workflow from a pattern (2026-06-10)

_New first-party skills; no wire-contract change._

Two **rig templates** join the first-party skills catalog — ready-made
workflow patterns any agent (or the editor's one-click "Start from a
template") can instantiate against the live Registry:

- **Write & Critique** — step 1 writes, step 2 critiques the actual output.
- **Audit & Brief** — step 1 inspects, step 2 writes the plain-language
  verdict.

Each template is a standard skill whose `assets/rig.json` carries the
skeleton (per-step registry queries + default instructions), and whose
SKILL.md documents the full public-API instantiation flow — so the same
pattern works for a human in the editor and an external agent over the API.

## 0.7.1 — Chain steps into real workflows (2026-06-10)

_Schema 4.2.0 (additive) · SDK 0.7.1 (TypeScript + Python)._

The build loop grows up: with an account you can now **chain multiple
tools into one workflow** — and watch the whole thing run as a single,
threaded flow.

- **Multi-step Rigs.** Your first tool leads the flow; "+ add harness"
  chains the next step. Each step has its own instruction and settings,
  and you can reorder or remove steps freely.
- **Threaded runs.** Run the Rig and each step's output feeds the next —
  ask step one to write something and step two to critique it, and the
  critique is about the *actual* output. The record is a run trace with
  each step's atomic trace nested under it.
- **My Rigs.** Name your Rig, keep several, and load any of them back
  into the workbench. Whichever you touched last is the one Rokha sees
  as "your rig."
- **Wire contract:** the authenticated run stream is now documented
  (schema 4.2.0, additive). Guests keep the full single-step loop.

## 0.7.0 — Build it, run it, read the trace (2026-06-10)

_Schema 4.1.0 (additive) · SDK 0.7.0 (TypeScript + Python)._

The big one: the **full build loop now works end to end, before you even
log in**. Pick any tool from the Registry, drop it into your Rig, give it
an instruction, hit **Save & Run** — Rokha executes it and the result
lands as a permanent, readable record (a *trace*).

**In the app:**

- **The Editor is now part of the main screen.** No separate sandbox —
  the Editor tab lays your workbench out right next to the chat: your Rig,
  a live map of its structure, Rokha's thinking, and a searchable Registry
  pane so you never have to leave to go find a tool.
- **Configure your harness.** Targeting a skill now opens a config panel:
  tell Rokha what to do with it (the instruction), optionally point it at
  a live tool server (it probes what's really there and builds the input
  form from the server's actual contract), and set parameters.
- **Run anything.** Tools with a live server get called for real. Tools
  without one — most of the catalog — Rokha runs *herself*, performing the
  skill and producing its output. Either way you get a trace.
- **Traces — your run history.** A new view lists every run with its full
  input and output. One tap asks Rokha to dissect what came back.
- **Remix goes all the way now.** The "watch Rokha build" button no longer
  stops after picking a tool — she discovers, targets, configures, runs,
  and reads the result, live, end to end.
- **Ask Rokha to build it for you.** Every config field has an "ask Rokha
  to fill" button — she edits the same Rig you see, and the screen updates
  as she works.

**In the SDK / wire contract (additive — your 4.0.0 code keeps working):**

- New documented endpoints: recent mesh activity, the guarded MCP
  probe/call proxy, the full **Rigs + Traces** surface (including its
  pre-login mirror), and the two live agent streams (Remix and Run).
- TypeScript: new `client.rigs` (with `.anon(sessionId)` for the pre-login
  mirror), `marketplace.discoverRecent()`, `marketplace.mcpProxy()`.
- Python: `list_rigs` / `get_rig` / `create_rig` / `update_rig` /
  `list_traces` / `get_trace` (all with an optional `anon_session_id`),
  `discover_recent()`, `mcp_proxy()`.

## App — A refreshed landing + a guided "Agent Skills" walkthrough (2026-06-09)

_A frontend/app pass. No SDK or wire-contract (`schemas/openapi.yaml`)
change — nothing here moves the SDK version._

The homepage got a ground-up refresh, and Rokha can now walk you through
the basics herself:

- **A cleaner first screen.** When you arrive in the void, a single
  floating **"What is Rokha?"** card explains the idea, with quick buttons
  to see what's trending, take a tour, or watch Rokha build something live
  (Remix). One tap on "What is Rokha?" gets you a plain-English, no-jargon
  explainer.
- **Built for phones.** The whole landing was reworked for mobile — the
  quick-start buttons lay out cleanly around the screen, tuck extras into
  tidy dropdowns to save space, and the footer keeps Docs / X / Contact as
  compact icons. Nothing important gets lost on a small screen.
- **A tidier top bar on phones.** The menu now holds the main destinations
  (Rokha, the Registry, the Editor), and the feed button moves up next to
  it — so the wasted gap beside the logo is gone and the quick-start
  buttons sit neatly under the bar. One less row of clutter, more room for
  the actual screen.
- **New guided tutorial — Agent Skills.** A short, narrated walkthrough of
  the thing everything here is built from: what a *skill* is, the open
  `SKILL.md` standard that lets **any** agent use it, and how you compose
  your own workflow from skills with **no code and no API keys**. It even
  pulls up a real trending skill so you can see one live.
- **Polish throughout** — a deeper, more tactile look for the floating
  void elements, highlights that stay locked onto whatever Rokha is
  pointing at (even while you scroll on a phone), and a calmer default
  view.
- **On phones, Rokha stays out of your way.** When you ask her something
  on a small screen, she no longer flips you over to a data view and away
  from what you were reading — she answers in chat and just points you to
  the feed if there's more to see. (On desktop, where the views sit beside
  the chat, she still pulls them up for you.)

## Docs — FAQ + Common Terms reference pages (2026-06-09)

_A docs pass. No SDK or wire-contract (`schemas/openapi.yaml`) change._

Two new plain-language reference pages, linked from the homepage:

- **FAQ** — what Rokha is, why come here, whether you need an account
  (you don't, to look around), and how to start.
- **Common Terms** — a glossary of the core building blocks (Skill,
  Harness, Rig, Trace) plus the words you'll see around the platform
  (the mesh, the Registry, Remix, the dashboard, and more).

## App — Rokha points right at what she means (2026-06-06)

_A frontend/app pass. No SDK or wire-contract (`schemas/openapi.yaml`)
change — nothing here moves the SDK version._

When Rokha talks about a skill, she now highlights it right where you're
reading — in her live thinking view — instead of flashing an unrelated
list. A few touches make her guidance easier to follow:

- **One clear highlight that waits for you.** Her "look here" cue uses a
  single, consistent accent color and **stays put until you engage** —
  hover it, click it, or just move on — rather than blinking away before
  you've found it.
- **Chat about any skill in one click.** Skill cards now carry a quick
  **"ask Rokha"** button, so you can dig into a skill without opening it
  up first.
- **Remix spotlights its pick.** When Rokha builds a Rig for you, she
  highlights the exact tool she chose (and only the latest one), so it's
  obvious what landed in your workflow.
- **A tidier dashboard default** plus small polish across the panels.

## App — a big step toward building workflows with agents (2026-06-04)

_A large product release. No breaking SDK or wire-contract
(`schemas/openapi.yaml`) change in this batch — the SDK version is unchanged._

The biggest update in a while. Rokha's core idea — *find tools, wire them
into a workflow, and run it* — now has real foundations you can touch, much
of it without even signing in.

- **Remix — watch Rokha build, live.** The headline. Press one button and
  Rokha autonomously builds a workflow from the live network in front of you:
  she discovers a real tool and targets it, streamed step by step so you can
  watch her work. It's the clearest answer to "what does Rokha actually do?",
  and it grows as the build-it features grow.
- **Build a workflow — the "Rig" foundation.** Rokha can now assemble tools
  into a flow (a **Rig**), run them, and keep a **trace**: a step-by-step
  record of what each tool did and what came back. As a guest you can
  discover a tool, target it, run it, and read the result — and your
  in-progress work is kept for your session.
- **Your dashboard, your way.** The heads-up display is now a composable
  grid — add, resize, and drag panels to build the view you want, and it
  remembers your layout. Rokha can also bring the most relevant panel into
  focus while you chat; if you'd rather she didn't, you can lock it.
- **See the network breathing.** New live views show what's *fresh*, what's
  *trending*, and who's *building*, plus a visual **Capability Graph** that
  maps how the tools relate to each other.
- **Clearer naming.** What we used to call "Constellations of Work (COWs)"
  are now simply **Rigs** everywhere — the word for a workflow you compose
  from tools.
- **Reliability groundwork.** Plenty of behind-the-scenes plumbing landed to
  support all of the above.

## App — manage your chat history (2026-06-04)

_A frontend/app pass. No SDK or wire-contract (`schemas/openapi.yaml`)
change — nothing here moves the SDK version._

Your conversations with Rokha are yours to manage now. You can **see,
rename, pin, and delete** your past chats — and clear out the ones you
don't need in a single click.

What this means for you:

- **It scales with your plan.** Higher tiers keep more saved
  conversations. When you reach your limit, the oldest **unpinned**
  conversation steps aside automatically — pinned ones are always kept —
  so you never have to babysit the list.
- **Pin what matters.** A pinned conversation won't be auto-retired and
  can't be deleted by accident (unpin it first).
- **Exploring without signing in works better, too.** Your in-progress
  work now sticks with you through the session instead of resetting at
  every step, and starting fresh truly wipes the slate. Abandoned guest
  work is cleaned up automatically after a day.

## Breaking — "COWs" are now "Rigs" (2026-06-01)

_A naming change to the wire contract (`schemas/openapi.yaml`). This is
a **breaking** change, so the schema goes to **4.0.0** and both SDKs to
**0.6.0**. Update your client if you filter or read listing types._

We renamed our composed-workflow concept. What we used to call a **COW**
("Constellation of Work") is now simply a **Rig** — a set of tools and
skills harnessed together into one autonomous workflow. Same idea, a
name that actually fits the rest of the vocabulary (harnesses, rigs).

What this means for you:

- **Listing type renamed.** The `listing_type` value `"cow"` is now
  `"rig"` everywhere it appears — in the Registry, in search filters,
  and in the schema's `listing_type` enum. Code that sends
  `listing_type: "cow"` or branches on it must switch to `"rig"`.
- **SDKs updated in lockstep.** `@rokha_ai/sdk` and `rokha-sdk` (Python)
  both ship `0.6.0` with the new type and a bumped `SCHEMA_VERSION`
  (`4.0.0`). `ro status` and the SDK drift check expect the server to
  serve `4.0.0`.
- **No other shapes changed.** Only the name moved — fields, endpoints,
  and auth are untouched.

## App — works on your phone now (2026-05-31)

_A frontend/app pass making the pre-release Rokha web experience hold
up on phones. No SDK or wire-contract (`schemas/openapi.yaml`) change —
nothing here moves the SDK version._

You can now open Rokha on a phone and actually use it. This pass
focused on the small-screen experience.

- **Built for thumbs.** Chatting with Rokha and reading her live feed
  both work cleanly on a phone now — text wraps instead of running off
  the edge, the menu stays on screen, and the buttons are big enough
  to tap without missing.
- **No more black screen on older phones.** Devices that can't run the
  fancy animated backdrop used to get a blank screen; now they get a
  clean branded backdrop instead, so the first impression always
  lands.
- **Lighter on mobile data.** Heavy parts of the page no longer load
  until you actually open them, so the app feels quicker and uses less
  data on a phone.
- **Polish.** Tidier spacing along the bottom of the screen and a
  cleaner header on the live feed.

## App — one cohesive look + expandable skill cards (2026-05-30)

_A frontend/app design pass on the pre-release Rokha web experience.
No SDK or wire-contract (`schemas/openapi.yaml`) change — nothing here
moves the SDK version._

The whole experience now feels like one product instead of a few
screens stitched together.

- **One calm, consistent look.** Chat, the live dashboard, and the
  Registry now share a single "steel & ice-blue" palette, with small,
  deliberate pops of color (cyan, green, violet) so it has life
  without feeling busy.
- **Skill cards work the same everywhere.** A tool or skill looks and
  behaves identically wherever you meet it — and opening one now
  **expands it in place**: in the Registry the card grows right in the
  grid and nudges its neighbors aside, instead of a small pop-up
  taking over the screen.
- **Easier to follow what Rokha is doing.** When Rokha works through a
  request, her steps read as a clean, scannable flow, and any tools or
  results she pulls back show up as tidy cards — not raw data dumps.
- **Bigger, clearer text** on large screens, and a tidier footer with
  evenly-sized controls.

**Where this gets us:** the experience of discovering tools, talking
to Rokha about them, and watching what she does now reads as one
coherent surface — another step toward the north-star journey
(discover → chat → build → keep it) feeling genuinely good to use.

**What's next:** turning the "build" step on — letting Rokha take a
tool you found and actually start composing something useful with it.

## App — Rokha chat, dashboard & registry polish (2026-05-30)

_A frontend/app update to the pre-release Rokha web experience. No SDK
or wire-contract (`schemas/openapi.yaml`) change — nothing here moves
the SDK version._

A round of UX work on the two halves of the experience: talking to
Rokha, and the live dashboard beside it.

- **Get back to your conversation in one tap.** A show/hide toggle for
  the chat lets you wander off into the registry or another panel and
  then flip straight back to your conversation with Rokha, instead of
  losing your place.
- **A calmer, easier-to-read chat.** The conversation now wears the
  same clean "glass" look as the rest of the dashboard, with clearer
  labels for who's speaking — Rokha or you.
- **Looks right on smaller screens.** On laptops and tablets the
  dashboard now drops the cramped desktop split for a simpler stacked
  layout — while keeping every panel and view you'd get on a big
  monitor. Nothing is removed on smaller screens; it just rearranges.
- **No more spill-over.** Fixed a visual glitch where cards inside the
  dashboard panels could bleed past the panel edge while scrolling.
- **Ask about anything in the registry, instantly.** Tapping a tool or
  skill in the Registry now drops a question about it straight into
  your chat with Rokha — no copy-paste, no losing your place.
- **Smoother, and easier on the eyes.** The animated background is
  lighter on your device, and the dashboard panels rest on a soft
  frosted layer so text stays crisp over the moving starfield behind it.

**Where this gets us:** chatting with Rokha and watching the live
dashboard now read as one coherent surface that holds up from a laptop
to a wide monitor — a real step toward the north-star journey (chat →
build → keep) feeling genuinely good to use, not just functional.

**What's next:** wiring up the remaining dashboard controls, making the
central orb react in real time to what Rokha is doing, and the
production hardening + public CLI/SDK release that gate a public launch.

## 0.5.0 — Federated LLM proxy (slice 1 of LLM routing)

**Additive. Schema bumped 3.1.0 → 3.2.0 (minor — 1 new endpoint). SDK 0.4.0 → 0.5.0.**

Adds typed bindings for the new federated LLM proxy. The proxy lets
any authenticated Rokha caller (CLI, SDK, third-party agent) forward
Anthropic-shaped `/v1/messages` requests through Rokha — using their
own BYO Anthropic key (if stored in their account) or the Rokha
tenant key with the free-tier daily rate limit.

### Added

- **`RokhaClient.llm`** (TS) / **`llm_proxy()` method** (Py):
  - `llm.proxy(body)` → forwards to `POST /api/v1/llm/proxy`. Body
    is the Anthropic messages request; response is Anthropic's
    response shape verbatim.
- TS exports `LlmClient` + `AnthropicMessagesRequest` +
  `AnthropicMessagesResponse` from index.
- `SCHEMA_VERSION` bumped to `3.2.0` in both SDKs.

### Wire contract (schema 3.2.0)

- New tag `llm`.
- New path `POST /api/v1/llm/proxy` with `bearerAuth` security.
- New components: `AnthropicMessagesRequest` + `AnthropicMessagesResponse`
  (intentionally permissive — `additionalProperties: true` — so the
  proxy stays a pass-through as Anthropic's API evolves).

### Server policy (Erebus)

- Caller's user-scoped BYO Anthropic key (via `agent_api_keys`) wins
  when present and bypasses the rate limit.
- Otherwise the tenant fallback is `ANTHROPIC_KEY_ROKHA_AGENT` env
  (then `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), and the existing free-tier daily limit
  (`LLM_DAILY_RATE_LIMIT`, default 100) applies — same shape as the
  agent chat routes.
- Only `claude-*` models. Default `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`.
- `stream=true` is rejected (slice 2 / v0.3.2 adds streaming).

### What this unlocks

- Third-party SDK callers can chat with Anthropic via Rokha (the
  user's account fronts the compute). They never see the key.
- Slice 2 — `rokha-agents` repoint to call the proxy instead of
  Anthropic directly — lands next session. After that, `ro up`
  works end-to-end without `ANTHROPIC_KEY_ROKHA_AGENT` on the
  local machine.

## 0.4.0 — CLI device flow (`ro login`)

**Additive. Schema bumped 3.0.0 → 3.1.0 (minor — 3 new endpoints). SDK 0.3.0 → 0.4.0.**

Adds typed bindings for the CLI device authorization grant (RFC 8628
adapted) that powers `ro login`. Full design:
[docs-internal/src/operations/cli-device-flow.md](../docs-internal/src/operations/cli-device-flow.md).

### Added

- **`RokhaClient.cliAuth`** (TS) / **`cli_auth_*` methods** (Py) — typed
  wrappers around the new endpoints:
  - `cliAuth.start({ scope?, client? })` → `CliDeviceStartResponse`
  - `cliAuth.poll(device_code)` → discriminated `CliDevicePollResponse`
    (`pending` / `slow_down` / `authorized` + jwt + identity / `expired` / `denied`)
  - `cliAuth.authorize(user_code)` — requires bearer JWT; binds the
    code to the caller's identity, mints a 30-day CLI-scoped JWT.
- **`RokhaClient.setAuthToken(jwt)`** (TS) / **`set_auth_token(jwt)`**
  (Py) — sets the Bearer token used on protected routes.
- TS exports `CliAuthClient` + the four response interfaces from index.

### Wire contract

- Schema 3.1.0 adds `/api/auth/cli/{start,poll,authorize}` and four
  components: `CliDeviceStartResponse`, `CliDevicePollResponse`
  (oneOf with `discriminator: status`), `CliDeviceAuthorizeResponse`.
- `SCHEMA_VERSION` bumped to `3.1.0` in both SDKs.

### Notes

- The CLI `ro login` ships in `rokha-cli` 0.3.0 (separate package).
- The Hecate `/cli` browser page is not yet shipped — until it is,
  the user must complete the `authorize` step by `curl`ing the
  endpoint with their existing session JWT. See the design doc.

## 0.3.0 — Schema drift detection wired

**Additive. Schema stays at 3.0.0. SDK 0.2.0 → 0.3.0.**

Closes the gap noted in the 0.2.0 release notes: SDK clients can now
verify they're talking to a compatible Erebus before sending requests.

### Added

- **`RokhaClient.SCHEMA_VERSION`** (TS class static / Py class attr) —
  the schema version this SDK build was compiled against (`3.0.0`).
- **`RokhaClient.checkSchemaCompat()`** / **`check_schema_compat()`** —
  fetches `/api/schema/version` and returns a `SchemaCompatReport`:
  - `match` — server and SDK agree
  - `minor-drift` — same major, server has a newer minor (forward-compatible)
  - `major-drift` — incompatible (SDK should refuse)
  - `unreachable` — schema endpoint did not respond
- TS: `SchemaCompatLevel` and `SchemaCompatReport` exported from index.
- Py: `SchemaCompatReport` dataclass exported from `rokha`.

The SDK does not throw on drift — callers decide whether to warn,
refuse, or proceed.

### Companion: rokha-cli 0.2.0

Same schema-version constant lives in the `ro` CLI (binary renamed
from `rokha` → `ro`). `ro status` runs the same drift check against
the configured Erebus.

## 0.2.0 — Agent rebrand: Hecate/Hex → Rokha Agent

**BREAKING. Schema bumped 2.0.0 → 3.0.0 (major). SDK 0.1.0 → 0.2.0.**

The resident agent is no longer "Hecate"/"Hex" — it is **Rokha**, the
breath that animates the flow. The agent and the framework now share
the name by design.

### Breaking changes

- **Agent routes renamed.** Every `/api/agents/hecate/*` endpoint is
  now `/api/agents/rokha-agent/*` (chat, chat/public, chat/stream,
  chat/stream/public, status, tools, history, clear, model-info,
  available-models). The old `/api/agents/hecate/*` paths are **gone**
  — there are no compatibility aliases. Callers must update.
- **Agent identifier.** The agent's id/dispatch token is now
  `rokha-agent` (was `hecate`). Any code passing `'hecate'` as the
  agent argument must pass `'rokha-agent'`.
- **MCP tool names.** Agent-owned MCP tools exposed at `/mcp/jsonrpc`
  are renamed `hecate_*` → `rokha_agent_*` (e.g. `hecate_remember` →
  `rokha_agent_remember`, `hecate_new_session` →
  `rokha_agent_new_session`). Any MCP client invoking these by name
  must update.
- **Discovery insight field.** `seed_hex` → `seed_rokha_agent` in the
  discovery insight payload.
- **TypeScript:** `AgentsClient.hecateChat()` → `rokhaAgentChat()`;
  all `agent` defaults are now `'rokha-agent'`.
- **Python:** `RokhaClient.agent_status()` / `agent_tools()` (and
  peers) now default `agent="rokha-agent"`.

### Migration

- Replace `/api/agents/hecate/` → `/api/agents/rokha-agent/` and the
  agent token `'hecate'` → `'rokha-agent'`.
- Replace MCP tool names `hecate_*` → `rokha_agent_*`.
- Server-side deployments: run the included DB migrations
  (erebus `011`, harnesses `008`, agents `003`) so seeded keys, rate
  limits, SYSTEM personality, and per-user model choice carry over.

### Notes

- `RokhaClient.SCHEMA_VERSION` / `nb.checkSchemaCompat()` are not yet
  implemented in this SDK (pre-existing gap, unrelated to this
  release); the canonical schema version is `info.version: 3.0.0` in
  `schemas/openapi.yaml`, served at `/api/schema/version`.
